#### Notes on instruction set:

1. mov (Move): ARM equivalent: MOV
2. jmp (Jump): ARM equivalent: B (Branch)
3. cmp (Compare): ARM equivalent: CMP
4. push: ARM equivalent: PUSH or STM (Store Multiple)
5. pop: ARM equivalent: POP or LDM (Load Multiple)
6. call: ARM equivalent: BL (Branch with Link)
7. ret: ARM equivalent: BX LR (Branch and Exchange, Link Register)
8. add: ARM equivalent: ADD
9. sub: ARM equivalent: SUB
10. and: ARM equivalent: AND
11. or: ARM equivalent: ORR
12. xor: ARM equivalent: EOR (Exclusive OR)

1. MOV (Move):
   - ARM syntax: MOV Rd, Operand2
   - This instruction moves a value into a register.
   - Example: MOV R0, #42 (moves the immediate value 42 into register R0)
   - It can also move the value of one register to another: MOV R1, R2

2. B (Branch, equivalent to jmp):
   - ARM syntax: B `<label>`
   - This instruction causes an unconditional jump to the specified label.
   - Example: B loop_start (jumps to the label 'loop_start')
   - There are also conditional branch instructions like BEQ (Branch if Equal), BNE (Branch if Not Equal), etc.

3. CMP (Compare):
   - ARM syntax: CMP Rn, Operand2
   - This instruction compares two values by subtracting the second from the first and updating the condition flags.
   - It doesn't store the result, only affects the flags.
   - Example: CMP R0, R1 (compares the values in R0 and R1)
   - Often used before conditional branches.

4. BX LR (Branch and Exchange, equivalent to ret):
   - ARM syntax: BX LR
   - This instruction is used to return from a subroutine.
   - LR (Link Register) contains the return address.
   - It branches to the address stored in LR and can switch between ARM and Thumb instruction sets.
   - In function epilogues, you might see: POP {PC} which achieves the same effect.

Some additional notes:

- ARM instructions can often include conditional execution, allowing you to add conditions to most instructions.
- The MOV instruction in ARM is more versatile than in x86, as it can perform some operations (like bitwise NOT) directly.
- ARM's B (Branch) instruction is simpler than x86's JMP, as ARM uses a fixed instruction length, making relative addressing straightforward.
- The CMP instruction in ARM, like in x86, is often followed by conditional instructions to make decisions based on the comparison.

### Examples

Here are a few examples of ARM instructions you might see in a debugger:

#### Example 1: Function Prologue

```assembly
push    {fp, lr}       ; Save frame pointer and link register
mov     fp, sp         ; Set up new frame pointer
sub     sp, sp, #16    ; Allocate 16 bytes on the stack for local variables
```

#### Example 2: Arithmetic and Logical Operations

```assembly
add     r0, r1, r2     ; r0 = r1 + r2
sub     r3, r4, r5     ; r3 = r4 - r5
and     r6, r7, r8     ; r6 = r7 & r8
orr     r9, r10, r11   ; r9 = r10 | r11
```

#### Example 3: Branching

```assembly
cmp     r0, #0         ; Compare r0 with 0
beq     label          ; Branch to label if r0 == 0
b       end            ; Unconditional branch to end
label:
    ; Code here
end:
```

#### Example 4: Memory Access

```assembly
ldr     r0, [r1]       ; Load value from address in r1 into r0
str     r2, [r3]       ; Store value from r2 into address in r3
ldr     r4, [r5, #4]   ; Load value from address (r5 + 4) into r4
```


### Arm Debugging with WinDbg

To find and use these instructions in WinDbg when debugging ARM code, you'll need to use specific commands and features. Here's how you can work with these instructions:

1. Disassembling code:
   Use the "u" (unassemble) command to view the disassembled code. This will show you the ARM instructions.
   
   Example:
   ```
   u <address>
   ```

2. Setting breakpoints:
   Use the "bp" command to set breakpoints at specific addresses or function names.
   
   Example:
   ```
   bp <address>
   ```

3. Stepping through code:
   - "t" (trace) to step one instruction at a time
   - "p" (step over) to step over function calls
   - "g" (go) to run until the next breakpoint

4. Examining registers:
   Use the "r" command to view and modify register contents.
   
   Example:
   ```
   r             // View all registers
   r pc          // View program counter
   r lr          // View link register
   ```

5. Searching for specific instructions:
   Use the "s" (search) command to find specific byte patterns in memory.

   For example, to search for the MOV R0, #42 instruction:
   ```
   s -a <start_address> L<length> MOV R0, #42
   ```

6. Using the Memory window:
   Open the Memory window to view and navigate through the disassembled code visually.

7. Conditional breakpoints:
   Set breakpoints that only trigger under certain conditions.
   
   Example:
   ```
   bp <address> ".if (@r0 == 42) {} .else {gc}"
   ```
   This breaks only if R0 equals 42.

Remember that when debugging ARM code in WinDbg:

- You may need to switch between ARM and Thumb mode using the ".arm" and ".thumb" commands if your application uses both.
- The exact syntax and appearance of instructions may vary depending on the specific ARM architecture version you're debugging.
- You might need to load symbol files or set the correct module base address for proper disassembly.
