## AES

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing data. It operates on fixed block sizes (128 bits) and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Here's an overview and code examples for AES encryption and decryption in C and C#.

### How AES Works

AES works by processing data in blocks of 128 bits through a series of transformations, using a secret key. The main transformations include:

1. **SubBytes**: A non-linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a lookup table (S-box).
2. **ShiftRows**: A transposition step where each row of the state is shifted cyclically by a certain number of bytes.
3. **MixColumns**: A mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.
4. **AddRoundKey**: Each byte of the state is combined with a round key; the round key is derived from the cipher key using a key schedule.

AES performs these steps in multiple rounds, depending on the key size:
- 10 rounds for 128-bit keys.
- 12 rounds for 192-bit keys.
- 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.

### AES Encryption in C

Using OpenSSL library for AES encryption:

**Encryption (C)**:
```c
#include <openssl/aes.h>
#include <openssl/rand.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void handleErrors(void) {
    fprintf(stderr, "An error occurred\n");
    exit(1);
}

void aes_encrypt(const unsigned char *plaintext, unsigned char *ciphertext, const unsigned char *key, unsigned char *iv) {
    AES_KEY enc_key;
    if (AES_set_encrypt_key(key, 128, &enc_key) < 0) {
        handleErrors();
    }
    AES_cfb128_encrypt(plaintext, ciphertext, strlen((const char *)plaintext), &enc_key, iv, NULL, AES_ENCRYPT);
}

void aes_decrypt(const unsigned char *ciphertext, unsigned char *plaintext, const unsigned char *key, unsigned char *iv) {
    AES_KEY dec_key;
    if (AES_set_decrypt_key(key, 128, &dec_key) < 0) {
        handleErrors();
    }
    AES_cfb128_encrypt(ciphertext, plaintext, strlen((const char *)ciphertext), &dec_key, iv, NULL, AES_DECRYPT);
}

int main() {
    unsigned char key[16] = "0123456789abcdef";
    unsigned char iv[AES_BLOCK_SIZE];
    if (!RAND_bytes(iv, AES_BLOCK_SIZE)) {
        handleErrors();
    }

    unsigned char plaintext[] = "Hello, World!";
    unsigned char ciphertext[128];
    unsigned char decryptedtext[128];

    aes_encrypt(plaintext, ciphertext, key, iv);
    printf("Encrypted: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen((char *)plaintext); i++) {
        printf("%02x ", ciphertext[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    aes_decrypt(ciphertext, decryptedtext, key, iv);
    printf("Decrypted: %s\n", decryptedtext);

    return 0;
}
```

### AES Encryption in C#

Using .NET's built-in `System.Security.Cryptography` library for AES encryption:

**Encryption (C#)**:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string key = "0123456789abcdef";
        string iv = "abcdef9876543210";
        string plaintext = "Hello, World!";

        byte[] encrypted = EncryptStringToBytes_Aes(plaintext, Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key), Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(iv));
        Console.WriteLine("Encrypted: " + BitConverter.ToString(encrypted));

        string decrypted = DecryptStringFromBytes_Aes(encrypted, Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key), Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(iv));
        Console.WriteLine("Decrypted: " + decrypted);
    }

    static byte[] EncryptStringToBytes_Aes(string plainText, byte[] Key, byte[] IV)
    {
        if (plainText == null || plainText.Length <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(plainText));
        if (Key == null || Key.Length <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(Key));
        if (IV == null || IV.Length <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(IV));
        byte[] encrypted;
        using (Aes aesAlg = Aes.Create())
        {
            aesAlg.Key = Key;
            aesAlg.IV = IV;
            ICryptoTransform encryptor = aesAlg.CreateEncryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);
            using (MemoryStream msEncrypt = new MemoryStream())
            {
                using (CryptoStream csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
                {
                    using (StreamWriter swEncrypt = new StreamWriter(csEncrypt))
                    {
                        swEncrypt.Write(plainText);
                    }
                    encrypted = msEncrypt.ToArray();
                }
            }
        }
        return encrypted;
    }

    static string DecryptStringFromBytes_Aes(byte[] cipherText, byte[] Key, byte[] IV)
    {
        if (cipherText == null || cipherText.Length <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(cipherText));
        if (Key == null || Key.Length <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(Key));
        if (IV == null || IV.Length <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(IV));
        string plaintext = null;
        using (Aes aesAlg = Aes.Create())
        {
            aesAlg.Key = Key;
            aesAlg.IV = IV;
            ICryptoTransform decryptor = aesAlg.CreateDecryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);
            using (MemoryStream msDecrypt = new MemoryStream(cipherText))
            {
                using (CryptoStream csDecrypt = new CryptoStream(msDecrypt, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read))
                {
                    using (StreamReader srDecrypt = new StreamReader(csDecrypt))
                    {
                        plaintext = srDecrypt.ReadToEnd();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return plaintext;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of AES Code

#### C Code:
1. **Initialization**: The AES key and IV (Initialization Vector) are initialized. The key is set with a length of 128 bits.
2. **Encryption**: The plaintext is encrypted using `AES_cfb128_encrypt`, which performs the encryption in CFB mode.
3. **Decryption**: The ciphertext is decrypted back to plaintext using `AES_cfb128_encrypt` with the `AES_DECRYPT` flag.

#### C# Code:
1. **Key and IV**: The key and IV are initialized as byte arrays.
2. **Encryption Method**: 
   - An `Aes` object is created, and the key and IV are assigned.
   - An encryptor is created using `CreateEncryptor`.
   - The plaintext is written to a `CryptoStream` which performs the encryption.
3. **Decryption Method**:
   - An `Aes` object is created, and the key and IV are assigned.
   - A decryptor is created using `CreateDecryptor`.
   - The ciphertext is read from a `CryptoStream` which performs the decryption.

## RC4

RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) is a stream cipher designed by Ron Rivest in 1987. It's a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encoding and decoding. Here's an explanation of how RC4 encoding and decoding work:

Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA):

1. Initialize an array S of 256 elements with values 0 to 255.
2. Create another array K of 256 elements filled with the encryption key, repeating it as necessary.
3. Use K to produce an initial permutation of S:
   - j = 0
   - For i from 0 to 255:
     j = (j + S[i] + K[i]) mod 256
     Swap S[i] and S[j]

Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA):

1. Initialize i and j to 0
2. To generate each byte of the keystream:
   - i = (i + 1) mod 256
   - j = (j + S[i]) mod 256
   - Swap S[i] and S[j]
   - Output S[(S[i] + S[j]) mod 256]

Encoding:

1. Generate a keystream using PRGA.
2. XOR each byte of the plaintext with the corresponding byte of the keystream.

Decoding:

1. Generate the same keystream using PRGA with the same key.
2. XOR each byte of the ciphertext with the corresponding byte of the keystream.

Key points:

1. The same process is used for both encoding and decoding.
2. The security relies on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm.
3. RC4 is vulnerable to several attacks and is no longer considered secure for sensitive applications.
4. The algorithm is simple and fast, making it suitable for low-power devices.

Remember, while understanding these algorithms is valuable for educational purposes, it's crucial to use modern, well-vetted encryption standards for any real-world applications requiring security.


RC4 is a stream cipher that encrypts data by combining it with a pseudorandom keystream. Here's a detailed explanation of how RC4 encryption works:

### Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA)

The Key Scheduling Algorithm initializes the permutation in the array `S`. `S` is a state array used to produce the keystream.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an array `S` with 256 entries and initialize it with values from 0 to 255.
   - Create another array `K` and fill it with the encryption key, repeating the key as necessary to fill `K`.

2. **Permutation of `S`:**
   - Perform a series of permutations on `S` using the key `K`.

Here is the pseudo-code for KSA:

```c
for i = 0 to 255
    S[i] = i
    K[i] = key[i % key_length]

j = 0
for i = 0 to 255
    j = (j + S[i] + K[i]) % 256
    swap S[i] and S[j]
```


### Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA)

The PRGA generates the keystream, which is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize two index variables, `i` and `j`, both set to 0.

2. **Keystream Generation:**
   - In a loop, the state array `S` is further permuted, and a byte from the keystream is generated and XORed with the plaintext byte to produce the ciphertext byte.

Here is the pseudo-code for PRGA:

```c
i = 0
j = 0

while generating keystream
    i = (i + 1) % 256
    j = (j + S[i]) % 256
    swap S[i] and S[j]
    t = (S[i] + S[j]) % 256
    keystream_byte = S[t]
    output keystream_byte
```

### Encryption/Decryption

Encryption and decryption are the same operations in RC4 because of the symmetric nature of the XOR operation.

1. **For each byte of plaintext/ciphertext:**
   - XOR the byte with the generated keystream byte to produce the ciphertext/plaintext byte.

Here is a simplified example of the encryption process:

```c
for k = 0 to message_length
    cipher[k] = message[k] XOR keystream_byte
```

### RC4 Encryption Routine in C

Here’s how the RC4 encryption routine looks in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void rc4_init(unsigned char *s, unsigned char *key, int key_len) {
    int i, j = 0;
    unsigned char k[256];

    for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
        s[i] = i;
        k[i] = key[i % key_len];
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
        j = (j + s[i] + k[i]) % 256;
        unsigned char temp = s[i];
        s[i] = s[j];
        s[j] = temp;
    }
}

void rc4_crypt(unsigned char *s, unsigned char *data, int data_len) {
    int i = 0, j = 0, k, t;

    for (k = 0; k < data_len; k++) {
        i = (i + 1) % 256;
        j = (j + s[i]) % 256;

        unsigned char temp = s[i];
        s[i] = s[j];
        s[j] = temp;

        t = (s[i] + s[j]) % 256;
        data[k] ^= s[t];
    }
}

int main() {
    unsigned char s[256];
    unsigned char key[] = "secretkey";
    unsigned char data[] = "Hello, World!";
    int data_len = strlen((char *)data);

    rc4_init(s, key, strlen((char *)key));
    rc4_crypt(s, data, data_len);

    printf("Encrypted: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < data_len; i++) {
        printf("%02x ", data[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Decrypt
    rc4_init(s, key, strlen((char *)key));
    rc4_crypt(s, data, data_len);

    printf("Decrypted: %s\n", data);

    return 0;
}
```

This example initializes the RC4 state array `S` with the provided key, encrypts a message by XORing each byte with the keystream, and then decrypts it back to the original message using the same process.

## XOR

XOR encoding is a simple encryption technique that uses the XOR (exclusive or) bitwise operation. Here's an explanation of how XOR encoding and decoding work:

Principle:
XOR has a useful property: (A XOR B) XOR B = A
This means XORing a value twice with the same key returns the original value.

Encoding process:
1. Take a plaintext message and a key.
2. Convert both to their binary representations.
3. XOR each bit of the plaintext with the corresponding bit of the key.
   - If the key is shorter than the message, repeat it as needed.
4. The result is the ciphertext.

Decoding process:
1. Take the ciphertext and the same key used for encoding.
2. XOR each bit of the ciphertext with the corresponding bit of the key.
3. The result is the original plaintext.

Example:
Plaintext: 1010
Key: 1100
Ciphertext: 1010 XOR 1100 = 0110

Decoding:
Ciphertext: 0110
Key: 1100
Plaintext: 0110 XOR 1100 = 1010 (original message)

Characteristics:
1. Simple and fast to implement.
2. Symmetric - same operation for encoding and decoding.
3. Provides minimal security - easily broken with frequency analysis.
4. Often used as a component in more complex encryption schemes.
5. Can be used to obfuscate data, but should not be relied upon for strong encryption.

XOR encoding is often used in basic data obfuscation or as a building block in more complex cryptographic systems. However, on its own, it's not considered secure for protecting sensitive information against determined adversaries.


### Other potential methods

Yes, there are several encryption methods that are more secure than XOR and relatively easy to implement, while not being as complex as AES. Here are a few options:

1. Blowfish:
   - Symmetric block cipher
   - Simple structure, easy to implement
   - Still considered secure for many applications
   - Faster than AES on 32-bit processors

2. Twofish:
   - Successor to Blowfish
   - More secure, but slightly more complex to implement
   - Was a finalist in the AES selection process

3. ChaCha20:
   - Stream cipher, part of the ChaCha family
   - Designed to be efficient in software implementations
   - Considered very secure and is used in many modern protocols

4. Salsa20:
   - Predecessor to ChaCha20
   - Simple design, easy to implement
   - Still considered secure for many applications

5. Triple DES (3DES):
   - Based on the older DES algorithm
   - More secure than single DES, though slower than modern alternatives
   - Relatively simple to implement if you understand DES

6. XTEA (eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm):
   - Very simple block cipher
   - Easy to implement and understand
   - Suitable for situations where simplicity is key

Remember, while these are easier to implement than AES, they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice depends on your specific requirements for security, speed, and ease of implementation. Also, for any serious application requiring security, it's always recommended to use well-vetted, standardized encryption libraries rather than implementing these algorithms yourself.
