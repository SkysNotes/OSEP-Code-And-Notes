There isn't a specific term for mixing C# with PowerShell commands, but this practice is often referred to as **embedding C# in PowerShell** or using **inline C# in PowerShell**. Both PowerShell and C# are part of the .NET ecosystem, so they share the same underlying **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**. PowerShell is built on top of the CLR, which allows you to seamlessly integrate C# code into PowerShell scripts.

### Key Points about Mixing PowerShell and C#:

1. **Shared CLR**: PowerShell and C# both run on the CLR, which allows for deep integration. This shared runtime environment means that you can use C# code directly within PowerShell functions and scripts. The syntax might be different, but both languages compile down to the same intermediate language (IL) and are executed by the CLR.

2. **Inline C# in PowerShell**: You can embed C# code directly in PowerShell using `Add-Type`, which allows you to define and compile C# classes or functions within a PowerShell script. Here's an example:
   
```powershell
   Add-Type -TypeDefinition @"
   public class MathHelper {
       public static int Add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }
   "@   # Call the C# method in PowerShell
   [MathHelper]::Add(5, 3)
```
   

3. **PowerShell's Flexibility**: PowerShell can access any .NET class or API, including C# libraries. It allows you to mix PowerShell commands with C# constructs. You can write complex logic in C# and leverage PowerShell's scripting capabilities and cmdlets in a unified script.

4. **Use of C# for Performance**: In cases where PowerShell alone might be slower (e.g., handling complex data types or doing performance-heavy computations), embedding C# can improve performance while keeping the script structure in PowerShell.

### Conclusion:
While thereâ€™s no special term for mixing the two languages beyond **inline C#** or **PowerShell with C#**, it all works seamlessly due to the shared **CLR**. This interoperability is one of the strengths of PowerShell within the .NET environment.
