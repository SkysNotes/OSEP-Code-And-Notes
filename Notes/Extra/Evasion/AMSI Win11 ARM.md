Disassembling and analyzing `AmsiScanBuffer` on Windows 11 ARM involves several steps. This function, part of the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI), is a common target for malware authors looking to bypass antivirus detection. Below is a general outline of how you can disassemble and analyze this function on an ARM-based Windows 11 machine.

### Steps to Disassemble `AmsiScanBuffer`:

#### 1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - **Virtual Machine:** If possible, use a virtual machine running Windows 11 ARM to avoid any risk to your primary system.
   - **Debugger:** Install a debugger that supports ARM architecture, such as WinDbg or Ghidra. WinDbg is available as part of the Windows SDK.
   - **Symbols:** Ensure you have access to the necessary symbol files for Windows components. You can configure WinDbg to download symbols from the Microsoft symbol server.

#### 2. **Locate `AmsiScanBuffer`**
   - `AmsiScanBuffer` is typically located in `amsi.dll`, which can be found in the `C:\Windows\System32\` directory.
   - Use a tool like **Ghidra** or **IDA Pro** to open `amsi.dll` and locate the `AmsiScanBuffer` function. Alternatively, use WinDbg to load `amsi.dll` into memory and set a breakpoint on `AmsiScanBuffer` to locate it.

#### 3. **Disassemble the Function**
   - In **WinDbg**, after loading `amsi.dll`, you can use the following commands:
     ```plaintext
     .reload /f amsi.dll
     x amsi!*AmsiScanBuffer
     ```
     This will give you the address of `AmsiScanBuffer`. To disassemble, use:
     ```plaintext
     u <address>
     ```
     or in **Ghidra** or **IDA Pro**, you can navigate to the address directly.

#### 4. **Analyze the ARM Assembly**
   - ARM assembly differs from x86/x64, so ensure you're familiar with ARM instructions.
   - Common ARM instructions include:
     - **LDR:** Load register.
     - **STR:** Store register.
     - **BL:** Branch with link (calls another function).
     - **CMP:** Compare registers.
     - **B:** Branch (jump to another location in code).

   - **What to Look For:**
     - **Comparison and Branching:** Check for instructions that compare the buffer contents to known signatures or patterns.
     - **Calls to Other Functions:** Look for calls to functions that might perform actual scanning or logging.
     - **Loops or Conditional Jumps:** These may indicate where the scan logic is implemented.
     - **Anti-Debugging or Anti-VM Checks:** Some versions of AMSI may include checks to detect if they are being debugged or run in a VM.

#### 5. **Identify Bypass Opportunities**
   - Once you identify the scan logic, look for ways it can be bypassed. For example, some bypass techniques involve modifying the return value of `AmsiScanBuffer` or changing conditional jumps so that they always return a "clean" result.
   - On ARM, the specific instructions for modifying register values or altering program flow will differ from x86/x64, but the concept remains the same.

#### 6. **Patch or Modify Code (for Testing)**
   - If you're testing bypass techniques, you might want to patch `amsi.dll` in memory or on disk. This can be done using a hex editor or directly in a debugger.
   - Always ensure you have a backup of the original `amsi.dll` and that you're working in a safe, isolated environment.

### Example ARM Instructions to Look For:

- **CMP** instructions might compare buffer contents or scan results.
- **BL** followed by a function address might indicate a call to the core scanning logic.
- **MOV**, **STR**, **LDR** instructions could manipulate the return value.

### Tools:

- **WinDbg:** For real-time debugging.
- **Ghidra:** Free and open-source, supports ARM disassembly.
- **IDA Pro:** Popular disassembler with ARM support (paid software).

### ARM Assembly Resources:

- **ARM Reference Manual:** Familiarize yourself with ARM instruction sets.
- **Online ARM Assembly Tutorials:** These can help bridge the gap if you're more familiar with x86/x64.

Overwriting memory locations in a DLL on Windows using ARM architecture requires an understanding of ARM assembly instructions and how they correspond to the behavior of functions within the DLL. Here’s a breakdown of both obvious and less obvious instructions and techniques you might consider when aiming to manipulate the function's return value:

### 1. **Obvious Instructions to Look For:**

   - **`MOV` (Move) Instruction:**
     - **Purpose:** Transfers data from one register to another.
     - **Example:** `MOV R0, #0` sets the register `R0` (often used for return values) to `0`. By modifying this, you can change the function's return value.
     - **Usage:** Modify the value moved into `R0` before the function returns to alter its outcome.

   - **`LDR` (Load Register) Instruction:**
     - **Purpose:** Loads data from memory into a register.
     - **Example:** `LDR R0, [R1]` loads the value from the address in `R1` into `R0`. Changing the memory address or value loaded can affect the function's logic or return value.
     - **Usage:** Alter the memory address or the value at that address to control what gets loaded into the register.

   - **`STR` (Store Register) Instruction:**
     - **Purpose:** Stores data from a register into memory.
     - **Example:** `STR R0, [R1]` stores the value in `R0` into the memory location pointed to by `R1`.
     - **Usage:** Modify the store operation to overwrite data that the function will later use to determine its return value.

   - **`BX LR` (Branch to Link Register):**
     - **Purpose:** This instruction typically ends a function by branching to the address stored in the link register (`LR`).
     - **Usage:** If the return value is stored in `R0`, changing its value just before `BX LR` executes can directly influence the function's return.

### 2. **Less Obvious Instructions/Techniques:**

   - **`CMP` (Compare) and `Conditional Branches (e.g., BEQ, BNE)`:**
     - **Purpose:** These instructions compare two values and then branch depending on the result (e.g., equal, not equal).
     - **Example:** `CMP R0, #1; BEQ some_label` compares `R0` to `1` and branches if they are equal.
     - **Usage:** Modify the comparison value or change the branch condition to alter the control flow, making the function take a different path or return an alternative value.

   - **`SUBS` (Subtract with Status Update) or `ADDS` (Add with Status Update):**
     - **Purpose:** These instructions perform arithmetic while also updating the flags (e.g., zero flag, negative flag).
     - **Example:** `SUBS R0, R0, #1` subtracts `1` from `R0` and updates the flags. The function’s logic might depend on these flags.
     - **Usage:** Change the arithmetic operation to influence flags and branch conditions, indirectly changing the function’s return.

   - **`BL` (Branch with Link):**
     - **Purpose:** Calls a subroutine and saves the return address in the link register (`LR`).
     - **Usage:** Redirect the function call to a different routine or hook the call to alter the return value before the function exits.

   - **`NOP` (No Operation):**
     - **Purpose:** Does nothing, used to fill gaps or for timing.
     - **Usage:** Replace critical instructions with `NOP` to disable certain checks or manipulations within the function, indirectly affecting the return value.

   - **`VSTR`/`VLDR` (Store/Load Floating-Point Register):**
     - **Purpose:** ARM supports floating-point operations, and these instructions store/load floating-point registers.
     - **Usage:** If the function operates on floating-point data, altering these instructions can modify the function’s floating-point return value.

   - **Inline Patching with Shellcode:**
     - **Technique:** Insert custom shellcode directly into the function, which overrides the normal execution path.
     - **Usage:** Overwrite the start of the function with a jump to your shellcode, which can perform any necessary operations and return a manipulated value.

### 3. **Hooking Techniques:**

   - **Function Hooking:**
     - **Method:** Redirect the function to your custom code by overwriting its entry point with a branch (`B`) or branch-and-link (`BL`) instruction to a hook function.
     - **Usage:** The hook function can then manipulate registers and return a different value.

   - **Import Address Table (IAT) Hooking:**
     - **Method:** Modify the IAT to point to a different function, which can then manipulate the data and return an altered value.
     - **Usage:** This is particularly useful if the function is an external API call.

### 4. **Using the ARM Stack Frame:**

   - **Stack Manipulation:**
     - **Method:** Modify stack-related instructions like `PUSH`, `POP`, `STMFD`, or `LDMFD` to change the data the function returns.
     - **Usage:** Alter the return address or data stored on the stack to control what the function returns.

### 5. **Advanced Techniques:**

   - **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP):**
     - **Method:** Manipulate the stack to control the flow of execution by chaining together small code sequences (gadgets) that end in a return instruction.
     - **Usage:** Use ROP to execute a series of instructions that set up a specific return value without needing to modify the function directly.

### **Key Points:**
- **Understanding the Function's Purpose:** Analyze what the function is supposed to return and where that value is set. Focus on registers like `R0` (or `R0-R3` for returning multiple values) as these are typically used for return values in ARM.
- **Non-Invasive Techniques:** If possible, use non-invasive methods like hooking or IAT modification to intercept and change return values without altering the DLL directly.
- **Testing:** Carefully test any changes in a controlled environment, as overwriting DLL memory can easily crash the program if done incorrectly.

By understanding and utilizing these ARM-specific instructions and techniques, you can effectively manipulate a DLL’s behavior to achieve your desired outcomes.

Bypassing AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) on Windows 11 ARM requires an understanding of how AMSI operates and where its defenses can be circumvented. AMSI is a security feature designed to help detect and block malicious code execution, particularly in scripts and dynamic content. `AmsiScanBuffer` is a key function in this interface that scans buffers of data for potential threats.

Here are some things you can look for when attempting to bypass `AmsiScanBuffer` on Windows 11 ARM:

### 1. **Memory Patching**
   - **Purpose:** Modify the AMSI-related code in memory to disable or weaken its scanning capabilities.
   - **Key Areas to Patch:**
     - **`AmsiScanBuffer` Function Return Value:** By patching the return value of `AmsiScanBuffer`, you can make it always return a benign result, effectively bypassing the AMSI check.
     - **Example:** Modify the `AmsiScanBuffer` function in memory so that it always returns `AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN` (which is typically `0`).
     - **ARM-Specific Instructions:** Look for instructions like `MOV R0, #0` (setting the return value) or branch instructions like `BX LR` that conclude the function, and patch them accordingly.

### 2. **Hooking**
   - **Purpose:** Redirect the AMSI function to your own code, which can manipulate or bypass the intended behavior.
   - **Hooking `AmsiScanBuffer`:**
     - **Method:** Use techniques such as Inline Hooking or Import Address Table (IAT) Hooking to intercept calls to `AmsiScanBuffer`.
     - **Custom Function:** Your hook function can bypass the scan by either returning a clean result or skipping the actual scanning logic.
   - **ARM-Specific Hooking:** Pay attention to the prologue and epilogue of functions, and ensure your hook preserves the original context on ARM.

### 3. **Reflection/Assembly Manipulation**
   - **Purpose:** Modify the runtime behavior of a process to disable AMSI without direct memory tampering.
   - **Reflection Techniques:**
     - **DotNet-Based Applications:** Use reflection in .NET applications to modify or remove AMSI integrations at runtime.
     - **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Modify the function pointers or other runtime data structures to bypass AMSI checks.
   - **ARM Considerations:** Adjust your code to correctly handle the ARM architecture’s calling conventions and register usage.

### 4. **Shellcode Injection**
   - **Purpose:** Inject shellcode that disables AMSI or prevents it from interfering with your payload.
   - **Shellcode Example:**
     - Inject a small shellcode snippet that patches or hooks `AmsiScanBuffer` in a process that is known to use AMSI (e.g., `powershell.exe`).
   - **ARM Shellcode:** Ensure your shellcode is written in ARM assembly or is compatible with ARM instructions.

### 5. **PowerShell-Based Bypass**
   - **Purpose:** Use PowerShell scripts or commands to disable or evade AMSI.
   - **Bypassing in PowerShell:**
     - **Patch AMSI in Memory:** A common technique involves locating the `AmsiScanBuffer` method within PowerShell's process memory and patching it.
     - **Disable AMSI Initialization:** Modify the PowerShell engine initialization process to skip or disable AMSI setup.
   - **ARM PowerShell:** Adapt these techniques to work on the ARM version of PowerShell, focusing on the correct memory addresses and ARM instructions.

### 6. **Environment Variable Manipulation**
   - **Purpose:** Some versions of AMSI are influenced by environment variables that can change their behavior.
   - **Example:** Setting or modifying certain environment variables might bypass or weaken AMSI's functionality in specific contexts.
   - **ARM-Specific:** Ensure that any environment-based bypass works on the ARM architecture and with the ARM-specific Windows environment.

### 7. **Exploit Weaknesses in AMSI Integration**
   - **Purpose:** Exploit known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how AMSI integrates with specific applications.
   - **Focus Areas:**
     - **Malware-Specific Bypass Techniques:** Some malware uses known bypass techniques that exploit weaknesses in AMSI integrations or their configurations.
     - **Application-Specific:** Certain applications might implement AMSI incorrectly or have weaknesses that can be exploited.
   - **ARM Context:** Ensure the vulnerabilities or weaknesses are present in the ARM version of the application or service you're targeting.

### 8. **Understanding AMSI's Workflow on ARM**
   - **Purpose:** Deeply understand how AMSI operates on ARM to find architectural weaknesses.
   - **Focus on:**
     - **Buffer Submission:** Identify where and how the buffers are submitted to AMSI and how you can intercept or modify this process.
     - **Return Values and Error Handling:** Exploit weaknesses in how return values and errors are handled within the AMSI pipeline on ARM.
   - **ARM Assembly Analysis:** Analyze the AMSI functions in ARM assembly to identify where you can introduce your bypass.

### **Precautions and Ethical Considerations:**
- **Legal Use Only:** Techniques to bypass security features like AMSI should only be used in legal contexts, such as penetration testing, research, or with explicit permission from the system owner.
- **Testing:** Always test your techniques in a controlled environment to avoid unintended consequences, such as system instability or detection by other security mechanisms.
- **Detection:** Be aware that bypass techniques might be detected by other security tools or monitored by security analysts.

By focusing on these areas and techniques, you can explore potential ways to bypass `AmsiScanBuffer` on Windows 11 ARM. Keep in mind that the security landscape is constantly evolving, and new protections or detection methods might mitigate some of these techniques over time.

Certainly! Disassembling and analyzing functions using WinDbg is a critical skill for reverse engineering and debugging on Windows, especially when working with ARM architecture. Below are the steps and instructions to get you started with using WinDbg for disassembling and analyzing functions like `AmsiScanBuffer`.

### **1. Setting Up WinDbg for ARM Debugging**

First, ensure you have the correct version of WinDbg installed that supports ARM architecture:
- **Download the ARM-compatible version of WinDbg** from the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).
- **Install the ARM symbols** by configuring the symbol path correctly.

### **2. Configuring Symbol Paths**
To make sense of the disassembly, you need to load the correct symbols:

```bash
.sympath srv*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
.reload
```

- This command sets the symbol path and loads symbols from Microsoft’s symbol server. Adjust the local path (`c:\symbols`) as needed.

### **3. Loading the Target Process**

Next, you need to attach WinDbg to the process you want to analyze. For example, if you want to examine `AmsiScanBuffer` within `powershell.exe`:

```bash
windbg -p <ProcessID>
```

Alternatively, you can start the process directly from WinDbg:

```bash
windbg -g -o "C:\path\to\powershell.exe"
```

### **4. Finding and Setting Breakpoints**

Identify the function you want to disassemble, such as `AmsiScanBuffer`, and set a breakpoint:

```bash
bp AmsiScanBuffer
g
```

- **`bp`**: Sets a breakpoint at the beginning of `AmsiScanBuffer`.
- **`g`**: Runs the program until it hits the breakpoint.

### **5. Disassembling the Function**

Once the breakpoint is hit, you can disassemble the function:

```bash
u AmsiScanBuffer
```

- **`u` (Unassemble):** This command disassembles the function starting at `AmsiScanBuffer`.

To view a specific range of instructions, specify an address range:

```bash
u <start address> <end address>
```

### **6. Analyzing the Disassembled Code**

When examining the disassembled ARM instructions, look for:

- **Function Prologue and Epilogue:** Identify where the function starts (`STMFD`/`PUSH`) and ends (`LDMFD`/`POP`, `BX LR`).
- **Critical Instructions:**
  - **`MOV`, `LDR`, `STR`:** Key instructions for moving, loading, and storing data.
  - **`CMP`, `BNE`, `BEQ`:** Instructions used for comparisons and conditional branching.
  - **Function Call (`BL`):** Look for branches to other functions and subroutines.

### **7. Modifying Execution Flow**

If your goal is to bypass or alter the function’s behavior, you can modify registers or memory at runtime:

- **Setting Registers Manually:**
  - Use the `r` command to examine or modify registers. For example:
  
    ```bash
    r R0=0  # Set the return value to 0 (AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN)
    ```

- **Patching Instructions:**
  - Use the `e` (enter) command to modify memory directly:

    ```bash
    eb <address> <new_value>
    ```

  - Example: Change a `MOV R0, #1` instruction to `MOV R0, #0` to alter a return value.

### **8. Stepping Through Code**

You can step through instructions to observe how the function operates:

- **Step Over (`p`):** Steps over a function call.
- **Step Into (`t`):** Steps into a function call, useful for analyzing nested functions.
- **Step Out (`pt`):** Executes the remaining instructions in the current function and stops after returning.

### **9. Inspecting Memory and Data Structures**

Use the `dd` command to inspect memory locations:

```bash
dd <address>
```

- This can be useful for checking data that `AmsiScanBuffer` might be scanning or modifying.

### **10. Dumping and Saving Disassembled Code**

To save the disassembled output to a file:

```bash
.logopen C:\path\to\log.txt
u AmsiScanBuffer
.logclose
```

### **11. Additional Considerations for ARM**

- **ARM Calling Conventions:** Registers R0-R3 are used for passing arguments and returning values. Be mindful of these when analyzing the function's entry and exit points.
- **Endianness:** ARM architecture can operate in both little-endian and big-endian modes. Ensure you’re interpreting the disassembly correctly based on the system’s configuration.

### **12. Debugging and Repeating**

Continue debugging, modifying, and analyzing the code until you achieve your objective. You can restart the debugging session if necessary to test different approaches.

### **Conclusion**

This process will give you a solid foundation for analyzing and modifying a DLL function like `AmsiScanBuffer` on Windows 11 ARM using WinDbg. Keep in mind that bypassing security features should only be done in controlled, legal environments such as during penetration testing or security research with appropriate permissions.
